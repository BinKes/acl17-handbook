This paper proposes a system that can detect and rephrase profanity in Chinese text.  Rather than just masking detected profanity, we want to revise the input sentence by using inoffensive words while keeping their original meanings.  29 of such rephrasing rules were invented after observing sentences on real-word social websites.  The overall accuracy of the proposed system is 85.56\%
