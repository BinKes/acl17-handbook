We present a feature-rich knowledge tracing method that captures a student's acquisition and retention of knowledge during a foreign language phrase learning task. We model the student's behavior as making predictions under a log-linear model, and adopt a neural gating mechanism to model how the student updates their log-linear parameters in response to feedback.  The gating mechanism allows the model to learn complex patterns of retention and acquisition for each feature, while the log-linear parameterization results in an interpretable knowledge state. We collect human data and evaluate several versions of the model.
