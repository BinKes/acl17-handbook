Extending semantic parsing systems to new domains and languages is a highly expensive, time-consuming process, so making effective use of existing resources is critical. In this paper, we describe a transfer learning method using crosslingual word embeddings in a sequence-to-sequence model.  On the NLmaps corpus, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.7\% for English.  Most importantly, we observed a consistent improvement for German compared with several baseline domain adaptation techniques.  As a by-product of this approach, our models that are trained on a combination of English and German utterances perform reasonably well on code-switching utterances which contain a mixture of English and German, even though the training data does not contain any such. As far as we know, this is the first study of code-switching in semantic parsing. We manually constructed the set of code-switching test utterances for the NLmaps corpus and achieve 78.3\% accuracy on this dataset.
