This paper describes the CMU submission to shared task 1 of SIGMORPHON 2017. The system is based on the multi-space variational encoder-decoder (MSVED) method of \newcite{zhou17acl}, which employs both continuous and discrete latent variables for the variational encoder-decoder and is trained in a semi-supervised fashion. We discuss some language-specific errors and present result analysis.
