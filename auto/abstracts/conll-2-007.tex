We describe our approach and experiments in the context of the CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017 Shared Task on Universal Morphological Reinflection. We combine a discriminative transduction system with neural models. The results on five languages show that our approach works well in the low-resource setting. We also investigate adaptations designed to handle small training sets.
