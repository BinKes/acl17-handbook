We introduce a modular approach for literature-based discovery consisting of a machine reading and knowledge assembly component that together produce a graph of influence relations (e.g., ``A promotes B'') from a collection of publications.  A search engine is used to explore direct and indirect influence chains. Query results are substantiated with textual evidence, ranked according to their relevance, and presented in both a table-based view, as well as a network graph visualization.  Our approach operates in both domain-specific settings, where there are knowledge bases and ontologies available to guide reading, and in multi-domain settings where such resources are absent. We demonstrate that this deep reading and search system reduces the effort needed to uncover ``undiscovered public knowledge'', and that with the aid of this tool a domain expert was able to drastically reduce her model building time from months to two days.
