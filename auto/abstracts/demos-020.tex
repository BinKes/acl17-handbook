Conventional customer service chatbots are usually built upon human dialogs, yet confronted with the problems of data scale and privacy. In this paper, we present SuperAgent, which is a customer service chatbot leveraging large-scale and public available e-commerce data. Distinct from existing counterparts, SuperAgent takes advantage of data from in-page product descriptions as well as user-generated content from e-commerce websites, which is more practical and cost-effective to answer repetitive questions, thereby freeing up support staffs to answer much higher value questions. We demonstrate SuperAgent as an add-on extension to mainstream web browsers and show its usefulness to user's online shopping experience.
