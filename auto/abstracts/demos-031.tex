Semedico is a semantic search engine designed to support literature search in the life sciences by integrating the semantics of the domain at all stages of the search process - from query formulation via query processing up to the presentation of results. Semedico excels with an ad-hoc search approach which directly reflects relevance in terms of information density of entities and relations among them (events) and, a truly unique feature, ranks interaction events by certainty information reflecting the degree of factuality of the encountered event.
