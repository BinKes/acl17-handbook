Demographically-tagged social media messages are a common source of data for computational social science.  While these messages can indicate differences in beliefs and behaviors between demographic groups, we do not have a clear understanding of how different demographic groups use platforms such as Twitter.  This paper presents a preliminary analysis of how groups' differing behaviors may confound analyses of the groups themselves.  We analyzed one million Twitter users by first inferring demographic attributes, and then measuring several indicators of Twitter behavior. We find differences in these indicators across demographic groups, suggesting that there may be underlying differences in how different demographic groups use Twitter.
