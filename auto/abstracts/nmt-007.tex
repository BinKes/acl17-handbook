While neural machine translation has been successful due to significantly better translation quality, it is hard to understand how and why such translation has been generated. To help the analysis, we propose an interactive beam search decoder, a webbased tool for visualizing and analyzing decoder behavior. We also propose methods and tool interfaces to modify attention layer of decoder and to observe its corresponding change. Finally, we show preliminary analysis of NMT behavior found with the tool we propose. This is a submission to the extended abstract track.
