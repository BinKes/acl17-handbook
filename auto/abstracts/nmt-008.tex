We present a simple and effective approach to incorporating syntactic structure into NMT  using graph-convolutional networks (GCNs). GCNs can produce representations of words that are sensitive to their syntactic neighborhoods. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on English-German and English-Czech translation tasks for different types of encoders and observe +1.2 and +0.7 BLEU point improvements, respectively, from using syntactic GCNs on top of BiRNNs. This is a submission to the extended abstract track.
