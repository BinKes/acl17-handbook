Chat systems have increasingly grown in importance with the widespread use of technology. This has spurred the development of open-domain dialog systems through neural models. These focus on generating long, relevant and informative responses to user queries. We present a novel approach to build a domain-aware neural dialog system to achieve the same. Our approach is based on the observation that each utterance in a conversation lies in a specific domain, the shift in domains is smooth and that the context in a conversation plays a vital role in deciding the response. To incorporate this observation, we propose two domain-aware models : a non-neural ensemble and a recurrent neural network based model that together with domain-specific sequence-to-sequence models generate pertinent responses. We evaluate these models on automatic metrics and compare the results to that of the Seq2Seq model. This is a submission to the extended abstract track.
