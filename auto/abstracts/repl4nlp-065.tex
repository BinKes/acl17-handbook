This paper discusses a potential problem with tree-sequence models that induce syntax, in that there exists a failure mode when naively treating the relationship between composition and parsing. The first section presents a tree-sequence model that induces syntax. The second section proposes a strategy that attempts to prevent coadaptation between composition and parsing. The third section covers a method for randomly sampling binary trees in a transition-based setting, a simple and useful technique for transition-based parsing models.
