In   this   paper   we                                 present               the Tren-toTeam  system  which participated  to  thetask  3  at  SemEval-2017                                (Nakov et al.,2017).We concentrated  our  work  onapplying   Grice   Maxims(used   in manystate-of-the-art Machine learning applica-tions(Vogel  et  al.,  2013; Kheirabadiand  Aghagolzadeh,  2012;  Dale  and Re-iter, 1995;  Franke, 2011))                                to              ranking  an-swers of a question by answers relevancy.Particularly, we  created  a                                ranker                    systembased on relevancy scores, assigned by 3main components:  Named entity recogni-tion,  similarity score,  sentiment analysis.Our system obtained a comparable resultsto Machine learning systems.
