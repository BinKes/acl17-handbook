This paper presents our submission to SemEval-2017 Task 6: \#HashtagWars: Learning a Sense of Humor. There are two subtasks: A. Pairwise Comparison, and B. Semi-Ranking. Our assumption is that the distribution of humorous and non-humorous texts in real life language is naturally imbalanced. Using Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial with standard text-representation features, we approached Subtask B as a sequence of imbalanced classification problems, and optimized our system per the macro-average recall. Subtask A was then solved via the Semi-Ranking results. On the final test, our system was ranked 10th for Subtask A, and 3rd for Subtask B.
