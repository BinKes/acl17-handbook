In this paper, we describe our system implementation for sentiment analysis in Twitter. This system combines two models based on deep neural networks, namely a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, through interpolation. Distributed representation of words as vectors are input to the system, and the output is a sentiment class. The neural network models are trained exclusively with the data sets provided by the organizers of SemEval-2017 Task 4 Subtask A. Overall, this system has achieved 0.618 for the average recall rate, 0.587 for the average F1 score, and 0.618 for accuracy.
