This article describes the distributional strategy submitted by the Citius team to the SemEval 2017 Task 2. Even though the team participated in two subtasks, namely monolingual and cross-lingual word similarity, the article is mainly focused on the cross-lingual subtask. Our method uses comparable corpora and syntactic dependencies to extract count-based and transparent bilingual distributional contexts. The evaluation of the results show that our method is competitive with other cross-lingual strategies, even those using aligned and parallel texts.
