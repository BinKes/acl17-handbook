The system developed by the SSN\_MLRG1 team for Semeval-2017 task 5 on fine-grained sentiment analysis uses Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process for identifying the optimistic and pessimistic sentiments associated with companies and stocks. Since the comments made at different times about the same companies and stocks may display different emotions, their properties such as smoothness and periodicity may vary. Our experiments show that while single kernel Gaussian Process can learn certain properties well, Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process are effective in learning the presence of different properties simultaneously.
