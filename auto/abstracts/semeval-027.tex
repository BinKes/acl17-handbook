This study proposes a system to participate in the Clinical TempEval 2017 shared task, a part of the SemEval 2017 Tasks. Domain adaptation was the main challenge this year. We took part in the supervised domain adaption where data of 591 records of colon cancer patients and 30 records of brain cancer patients from Mayo clinic were given and we are asked to analyze the records from brain cancer patients. Based on the THYME corpus released by the organizer of Clinical TempEval, we propose a framework that automatically analyzes clinical temporal events in a fine-grained level. Support vector machine (SVM) and conditional random field (CRF) were implemented in our system for different subtasks, including detecting clinical relevant events and time expression, determining their attributes, and identifying their relations with each other within the document. The results showed the capability of domain adaptation of our system.
