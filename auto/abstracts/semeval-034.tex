This paper describes the improvements that we have applied on CAMR baseline parser (Wang et al., 2016) at Task 8 of SemEval-2016. Our objective is to increase the performance of CAMR when parsing sentences from scientific articles, especially articles of biology domain more accurately. To achieve this goal, we built two wrapper layers for CAMR. The first layer, which covers the input data, will normalize, add necessary information to the input sentences to make the input dependency parser and the aligner better handle reference citations, scientific figures, formulas, etc. The second layer, which covers the output data, will modify and standardize output data based on a list of scientific concept fixing patterns. This will help CAMR better handle biological concepts which are not in the training dataset. Finally, after applying our approach, CAMR has scored 0.65 F-score on the test set of Biomedical training data and 0.61 F-score on the official blind test dataset.
