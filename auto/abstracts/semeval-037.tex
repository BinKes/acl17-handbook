This paper describes the TWINA system, with which we participated in SemEval-2017 Task 4B (Topic Based Message Polarity Classification --- Two point scale) and 4D (two-point scale Tweet quantification). We implemented ensemble based Gradient Boost Trees classification method for both the tasks. Our system could perform well for the task 4D and ranked 13th among 15 teams, for the task 4B our model ranked 23rd position.
