We describe our system (DT Team) submitted at SemEval-2017 Task 1, Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) challenge for English (Track 5). We developed three different models with various features including similarity scores calculated using word and chunk alignments, word/sentence embeddings, and Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). The correlation between our system's output and the human judgments were up to 0.8536, which is more than 10\% above baseline, and almost as good as the best performing system which was at 0.8547 correlation (the difference is just about 0.1\%). Also, our system produced leading results when evaluated with a separate STS benchmark dataset. The word alignment and sentence embeddings based features were found to be very effective.
