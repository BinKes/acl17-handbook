We describe a method of calculating the similarity of questions in community QA. Question in cQA are usually very long and there are a lot of useless information about calculating the similarity of questions. Therefore,we implement a CNN model based on similar and dissimilar information between question's keywords. We extract the keywords of questions, and then model the similar and dissimilar information between the keywords, and use the CNN model to calculate the similarity.
