This paper presents a system developed for SemEval-2017 Task 7, Detection and Interpretation of English Puns consisting of three subtasks; pun detection, pun location, and pun interpretation, respectively. The system stands on recognizing a distinctive word which has a high association with the pun in the given sentence. The intended humorous meaning of pun is identified through the use of this word. Our official results confirm the potential of this approach.
