This article describes our proposed system  named LIM-LIG. This system is designed for SemEval 2017 Task1: Semantic  Textual  Similarity (Track1). LIM-LIG  proposes  an  innovative  enhancement to word embedding-based model devoted  to    measure                                            the  semantic similarity in Arabic sentences. The  main  idea  is  to  exploit    the  word representations  as  vectors  in a  multidimensional  space    to    capture  the  semantic  and  syntactic properties  of                                              words. IDF weighting and Part-of-Speech                                tagging are applied  on  the  examined  sentences  to  support    the  identification  of words  that  are  highly  descriptive  in  each  sentence.  LIM-LIG system achieves a Pearson\'s correlation of 0.74633, ranking 2nd among all participants in the   Arabic monolingual pairs STS task organized within the SemEval 2017 evaluation campaign
