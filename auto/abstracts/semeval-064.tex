In this Paper a system for solving SemEval-2017 Task 5 is presented. This task is divided into two tracks where the sentiment of microblog messages and news headlines has to be predicted. Since two submissions were allowed, two different machine learning methods were developed to solve this task, a support vector machine approach and a recurrent neural network approach. To feed in data for these approaches, different feature extraction methods are used, mainly word representations and lexica. The best submissions for both tracks are provided by the recurrent neural network which achieves a F1-score of 0.729 in track 1 and 0.702 in track 2.
