This paper describes a supervised solution for detecting the polarity scores of tweets or headline news in the financial domain, submitted to the SemEval 2017 Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News Task. The premise is that it is possible to understand market reaction over a company stock by measuring the positive/negative sentiment contained in the financial tweets and news headlines, where polarity is measured in a continuous scale ranging from -1.0 (very bearish) to 1.0 (very bullish). Our system receives as input the textual content of tweets or news headlines, together with their ids, stock cashtag or name of target company, and the polarity score gold standard for the training dataset. Our solution retrieves features from these text instances using n-gram, hashtags, sentiment score calculated by a external APIs and others features to train a regression model capable to detect continuous score of these sentiments with precision.
