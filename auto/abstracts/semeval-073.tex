This paper reports the details of our submissions in the task 1 of SemEval 2017. This task aims at assessing the semantic textual similarity of two sentences or texts. We submit three unsupervised systems based on word embeddings. The differences between these runs are the various preprocessing on evaluation data. The best performance of these systems on the evaluation of Pearson correlation is 0.6887. Unsurprisingly, results of our runs demonstrate that data preprocessing, such as tokenization, lemmatization, extraction of content words and removing stop words, is helpful and plays a significant role in improving the performance of models.
