This paper describes the participation of ELiRF-UPV team at task 7 (subtask 2: homographic pun detection and subtask 3: homographic pun interpretation) of SemEval2017. Our approach is based on the use of word embeddings to find related words in a sentence and a version of the Lesk algorithm to establish relationships between synsets. The results obtained are in line with those obtained by the other participants and they encourage us to continue working on this problem.
