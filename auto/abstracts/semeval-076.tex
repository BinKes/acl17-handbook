Sentiment analysis is one of the central issues in Natural Language Processing and has become more and more important in many fields. Typical sentiment analysis classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes (e.g.,positive or negative). In this paper we describe our deep learning system(combining GRU and SVM) to solve both two-, three- and five- tweet polarity classifications. We first trained a gated recurrent neural network using pre-trained word embeddings, then we extracted features from GRU layer and input these features into support vector machine to fulfill both the classification and quantification subtasks. The proposed approach achieved 37th, 19th, and 14rd places in subtasks A, B and C, respectively.
