Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) devotes to measuring the degree of equivalence in the underlying semantic of the sentence pair. We proposed a new system, ITNLP-AiKF, which applies in the SemEval 2017 Task1 Semantic Textual Similarity track 5 English monolingual pairs. In our system, rich features are involved, including Ontology based, word embedding based, Corpus based, Alignment based and Literal based feature. We leveraged the features to predict sentence pair similarity by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. In the result, a Pearson Correlation of 0.8231 is achieved by our system, which is a competitive result in the contest of this track.
