We describes deep neural networks frameworks in this paper to address the community question answering (cQA) ranking task (SemEval-2017 task 3). Convolutional neural networks and bi-directional long-short term memory networks are applied in our methods to extract semantic information from questions and answers (comments). In addition, in order to take the full advantage of question-comment semantic relevance, we deploy interaction layer and augmented features before calculating the similarity. The results show that our methods have the great effectiveness for both subtask A and subtask C.
