This study describes the design of the NTNU system for the ScienceIE task at the SemEval 2017 workshop. We use self-defined feature templates and multiple conditional random fields with extracted features to identify keyphrases along with categorized labels and their relations from scientific publications. A total of 16 teams participated in evaluation scenario 1 (subtasks A, B, and C), with only 7 teams competing in all sub-tasks. Our best micro-averaging F1 across the three subtasks is 0.23, ranking in the middle among all 16 submissions.
