We present the contribution of Universitat Pompeu Fabra's NLP group to the SemEval Task 9.2 (AMR-to-English Generation). The proposed generation pipeline comprises: (i) a series of rule-based graph-transducers for the syntacticization of the input graphs and the resolution of morphological agreements, and (ii) an off-the-shelf statistical linearization component.
