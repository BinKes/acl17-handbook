This paper describes the participation of ELiRF-UPV team at task 4 of SemEval2017. Our approach is based on the use of convolutional and recurrent neural networks and the combination of general and specific word embeddings with polarity lexicons. We participated in all of the proposed subtasks both for English and Arabic languages using the same system with small variations.
