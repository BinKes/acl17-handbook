This paper describes the XJSA System submission from XJTU. Our system was created for SemEval2017 Task 4 --- subtask A which is very popular and fundamental. The system is based on convolutional neural network and word embedding. We used two pre-trained word vectors and adopt a dynamic strategy for k-max pooling.
