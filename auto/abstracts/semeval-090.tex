We propose a sentiment analyzer for the prediction of document-level sentiments of English micro-blog messages from Twitter. The proposed method is based on lexicon integrated convolutional neural networks with attention (LCA). Its performance was evaluated using the datasets provided by SemEval competition (Task 4). The proposed sentiment analyzer obtained an average F1 of 55.2\%, an average recall of 58.9\% and an accuracy of 61.4\%.
