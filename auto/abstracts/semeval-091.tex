This paper describes our approach for SemEval-2017 Task 4 - Sentiment Analysis in Twitter (SAT). Its five subtasks are divided into two categories: (1) sentiment classification, i.e., predicting topic-based tweet sentiment polarity, and (2) sentiment quantification, that is, estimating the sentiment distributions of a set of given tweets. We build a convolutional sentence classification system for the task of SAT. Official results show that the experimental results of our system are comparative.
