Task 5 of SemEval-2017 involves fine-grained sentiment analysis on financial microblogs and news.  Our solution for determining the sentiment score extends an earlier convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis in several ways. We explicitly encode a focus on a particular company, we apply a data augmentation   scheme, and use a larger data collection to complement the small training data provided by the task organizers.                          The best results were achieved by training a model on an external dataset and then tuning it using the provided training dataset.
