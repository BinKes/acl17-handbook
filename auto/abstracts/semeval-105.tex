This paper describes the system developed at LIA for the SemEval-2017 evaluation campaign. The goal of Task 4.A was to identify sentiment polarity in tweets. The system is an ensemble of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM). We initialize the input representation of DNN with different sets of embeddings trained on large datasets. The ensemble of DNNs are combined using a score-level fusion approach. The system ranked 2nd at SemEval-2017 and obtained an average recall of 67.6\%.
