This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2017 Task 10. We competed in Subtask 1 and 2 which consist respectively in identifying all the key phrases in scientific publications and label them with one of the three categories: Task, Process, and Material. These scientific publications are selected from Computer Science, Material Sciences, and Physics domains. We followed a supervised approach for both subtasks by using a sequential classifier (CRF - Conditional Random Fields). For generating our solution we used a web-based application implemented in the EU-funded research project, named CODE. Our system achieved an F1 score of 0.39 for the Subtask 1 and 0.28 for the Subtask 2.
