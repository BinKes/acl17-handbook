This paper describes the system used in SemEval-2017 Task 4 (Subtask A): Message Polarity Classification for both English and Arabic languages. Our proposed system is an ensemble of two layers, the first one uses our generic framework for multilingual polarity classification (B4MSA) and the second layer combines all the decision function values predicted by B4MSA systems using a non-linear function evolved using a Genetic Programming system, EvoDAG. With this approach, the best performances reached by our system were macro-recall 0.68 (English) and 0.477 (Arabic) which set us in sixth and fourth positions in the results table, respectively.
