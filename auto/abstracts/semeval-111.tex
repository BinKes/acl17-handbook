In this paper we describe our system created for SemEval-2017 Task 7: Detection and Interpretation of English Puns. We tackle subtask 1, pun detection, by leveraging features selected from sentences to design a classifier that can disambiguate between the presence or absence of a pun. We address subtask 2, pun location, by utilizing a decision flow structure that uses presence or absence of certain features to decide the next action. The results obtained by our system are encouraging, considering the simplicity of the system. We consider this system as a precursor for deeper exploration on efficient feature selection for pun detection.
