This paper describes our system, entitled Idiom Savant, for the 7th Task of the Se- meval 2017 workshop, ``Detection and in- terpretation of English Puns''. Our sys- tem consists of two probabilistic models for each type of puns using Google n- gram and Word2Vec. Our system achieved f-score of calculating, 0.663, and 0.07 in homographic puns and 0.8439, 0.6631, and 0.0806 in heterographic puns in task 1, task 2, and task 3 respectively.
