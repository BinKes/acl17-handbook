This paper describes our approach for SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. We have participated in Subtask A: Message Polarity Classification subtask and  developed two systems. The first system  uses  word embeddings for feature representation and Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms for classification of Twitter messages into negative, neutral and positive polarity. The second system is based on Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks and uses word indexes as sequence of inputs for feature representation.
