We present the system developed by the team DUTH for the participation in Semeval-2017 task 5 - Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News, in subtasks A and B. Our approach to determine the sentiment of Microblog Messages and News Statements \& Headlines is based on linguistic preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning techniques. To train our model, we used Neural Network Regression, Linear Regression, Boosted Decision Tree Regression and Decision Forrest Regression classifiers to forecast sentiment scores. At the end, we present an error measure, so as to improve the performance about forecasting methods of the system.
