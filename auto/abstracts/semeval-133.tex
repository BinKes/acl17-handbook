In this paper, we describe our participation at the subtask of extraction of relationships between two identified keyphrases. This task can be very helpful in improving search engines for scientific articles. Our approach is based on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the training dataset. This deep learning model has already achieved successful results for the extraction relationships between named entities. Thus, our hypothesis is that this model can be also applied to extract relations between keyphrases. The official results of the task show that our architecture obtained an F1-score of 0.38\% for Keyphrases Relation Classification. This performance is lower than the expected due to the generic preprocessing phase and the basic configuration of the CNN model, more complex architectures are proposed as future work to increase the classification rate.
