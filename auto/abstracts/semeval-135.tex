We describe a modified shared-LSTM network for the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task at SemEval-2017. The network builds on previously explored Siamese network architectures. We treat max sentence length as an additional hyperparameter to be tuned (beyond learning rate, regularization, and dropout). Our results demonstrate that hand-tuning max sentence training length significantly improves final accuracy. After optimizing hyperparameters, we train the network on the multilingual semantic similarity task using pre-translated sentences. We achieved a correlation of 0.4792 for all the subtasks.  We achieved the fourth highest team correlation for Task 4b, which was our best relative placement.
