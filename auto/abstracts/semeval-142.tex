In this paper, we propose a multi-channel convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model that consists of two parts: multi-channel CNN and LSTM to analyze the sentiments of short English messages from Twitter. Un-like a conventional CNN, the proposed model applies a multi-channel strategy that uses several filters of different length to extract active local n-gram features in different scales. This information is then sequentially composed using LSTM. By combining both CNN and LSTM, we can consider both local information within tweets and long-distance dependency across tweets in the classification process. Officially released results show that our system outperforms the baseline algo-rithm.
