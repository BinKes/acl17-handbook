In this paper, we present our systems for the ``SemEval-2017 Task-5 on Fine- Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News''. In our system, we combined hand-engineered lexical, sentiment and metadata features, the representations learned from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) with Attention model applied on top. With this architecture we obtained weighted cosine similarity scores of 0.72 and 0.74 for subtask-1 and subtask-2, respectively. Using the official scoring system, our system ranked the second place for subtask-2 and eighth place for the subtask-1. It ranked first for both of the subtasks by the scores achieved by an alternate scoring system.
