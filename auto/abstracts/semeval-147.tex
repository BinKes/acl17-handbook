This paper describes the submission of team TSA-INF to SemEval-2017 Task 4 Subtask A. The submitted system is an ensemble of three varying deep learning architectures for sentiment analysis. The core of the architecture is a convolutional neural network that performs well on text classification as is. The second subsystem is a gated recurrent neural network implementation. Additionally, the third system integrates opinion lexicons directly into a convolution neural network architecture. The resulting ensemble of the three architectures achieved a top ten ranking with a macro-averaged recall of 64.3\%. Additional results comparing variations of the submitted system are not conclusive enough to determine a best architecture, but serve as a benchmark for further implementations.
