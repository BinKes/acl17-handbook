We describe our submissions for SemEval-2017 Task{\textasciitilde}8, Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours. The Digital Curation Technologies (DKT) team at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) participated in two subtasks: Subtask A (determining the stance of a message) and Subtask B (determining veracity of a message, closed variant). In both cases, our implementation consisted of a Multivariate Logistic Regression (Maximum Entropy) classifier coupled with hand-written patterns and rules (heuristics) applied in a post-process cascading fashion. We provide a detailed analysis of the system performance and report on variants of our systems that were not part of the official submission.
