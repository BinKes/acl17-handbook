To address semantic similarity on multilingual and cross-lingual sentences, we firstly translate other foreign languages into English, and then feed our monolingual English system with various interactive features. Our system is further supported by combining with deep learning semantic similarity and our best run achieves the mean Pearson correlation 73.16\% in primary track.
