This paper describes the winning system for SemEval-2017 Task 6: \#HashtagWars: Learning a Sense of Humor. Humor detection has up until now been predominantly addressed using feature-based approaches. Our system utilizes recurrent deep learning methods with dense embeddings to predict humorous tweets from the \@midnight show \#HashtagWars. In order to include both meaning and sound in the analysis, GloVe embeddings are combined with a novel phonetic representation to serve as input to an LSTM component. The output is combined with a character-based CNN model, and an XGBoost component in an ensemble model which achieves 0.675 accuracy on the evaluation data.
