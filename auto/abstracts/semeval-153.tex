This paper describes our TTI-COIN system that participated in SemEval-2017 Task 10. We investigated appropriate embeddings to adapt a neural end-to-end entity and relation extraction system LSTM-ER to this task. We participated in the full task setting of the entity segmentation, entity classification and relation classification (scenario 1) and the setting of relation classification only (scenario 3). The system was directly applied to the scenario 1 without modifying the codes thanks to its generality and flexibility. Our evaluation results show that the choice of appropriate pre-trained embeddings affected the performance significantly. With the best embeddings, our system was ranked third in the scenario 1 with the micro F1 score of 0.38. We also confirm that our system can produce the micro F1 score of 0.48 for the scenario 3 on the test data, and this score is close to the score of the 3rd ranked system in the task.
