This paper describes the system submitted to SemEval-2017 Task 4-A Sentiment Analysis in Twitter developed by the UCSC-NLP team. We studied how relationships between sense n-grams and sentiment polarities can contribute to this task, i.e. co-occurrences of WordNet senses in the tweet, and the polarity. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of discarding a large set of features based on char-grams reported in preceding works. Based on these elements, we developed a SVM system, which exploring SentiWordNet as a polarity lexicon. It achieves an \$F\_1=0.624\$ of average. Among \$39\$ submissions to this task, we ranked \$10th\$.
