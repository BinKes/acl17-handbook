In this paper, we describe the system of the KULeuven-LIIR submission for Clinical TempEval 2017. We participated in all six subtasks, using a combination of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for event and temporal expression detection, and a structured perceptron for extracting temporal relations. Moreover, we present and analyze the results from our submissions, and verify the effectiveness of several system components. Our system performed above average for all subtasks in both phases.
