In this paper, we describe our proposed method for measuring semantic similarity for a given pair of words at SemEval-2017 monolingual semantic word similarity task. We use a combination of knowledge-based and corpus-based techniques. We use FarsNet, the Persian Word Net, besides deep learning techniques to extract the similarity of words. We evaluated our proposed approach on Persian (Farsi) test data at SemEval-2017. It outperformed the other participants and ranked the first in the challenge.
