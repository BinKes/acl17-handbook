This paper describes a text-ranking system developed by bunji team in SemEval-2017 Task 3: Community Question Answering, Subtask A and C. The goal of the task is to re-rank the comments in a question-and-answer forum such that useful comments for answering the question are ranked high. We proposed a method that combines neural similarity features and hand-crafted comment plausibility features, and we modeled inter-comments relationship using conditional random field. Our approach obtained the fifth place in the Subtask A and the second place in the Subtask C.
