This paper describes the systems we submitted to the task 3 (Community Ques- tion Answering) in SemEval 2017 which contains three subtasks on English corpora, i.e., subtask A: Question-Comment Similarity, subtask B: Question-Question Similarity, and subtask C: Question-External Comment Similarity. For subtask A, we combined two different methods to represent question-comment pair, i.e., supervised model using traditional features and Convolutional Neural Network. For subtask B, we utilized the information of snippets returned from Search Engine with question subject as query. For subtask C, we ranked the comments by multiplying the probability of the pair related question comment being Good by the reciprocal rank of the related question.
