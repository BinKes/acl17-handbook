This paper describes our systems submitted to the Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News task (i.e., Task 5) in SemEval-2017. This task includes two subtasks in microblogs and news headline domain respectively. To settle this problem, we extract four types of effective features, including linguistic features, sentiment lexicon features, domain-specific features and word embedding features. Then we employ these features to construct models by using ensemble regression algorithms. Our submissions rank 1st and rank 5th in subtask 1 and subtask 2 respectively.
