This paper presents Wild Devs' participation in the SemEval-2017 Task 2 ``Multi-lingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity'', which tries to automatically measure the semantic similarity between two words. The system was build using neural networks, having as input a collection of word pairs, whereas the output consists of a list of scores, from 0 to 4, corresponding to the degree of similarity between the word pairs.
