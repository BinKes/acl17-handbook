This paper describes our submissions to task 7 in SemEval 2017, i.e., Detection and Interpretation of English Puns. We participated in the first two subtasks, which are to detect and locate English puns respectively. For subtask 1, we presented a supervised system to determine whether or not a sentence contains a pun using similarity features calculated on sense vectors or cluster center vectors. For subtask 2, we established an unsupervised system to locate the pun by scoring each word in the sentence and we assumed that the word with the smallest score is the pun.
