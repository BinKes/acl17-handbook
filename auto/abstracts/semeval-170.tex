The majority of core techniques to solve many problems in Community Question Answering (CQA) task rely on similarity computation. This work focuses on similarity between two sentences (or questions in subtask B) based on word embeddings. We exploit words importance levels in sentences or questions for similarity features, for classification and ranking with machine learning. Using only 2 types of similarity metric, our proposed method has shown comparable results with other complex systems. This method on subtask B 2017 dataset is ranked on position 7 out of 13 participants. Evaluation on 2016 dataset is on position 8 of 12, outperforms some complex systems. Further, this finding is explorable and potential to be used as baseline and extensible for many tasks in CQA and other textual similarity based system.
