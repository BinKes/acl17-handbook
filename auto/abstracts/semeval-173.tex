In this paper we introduce our system participating at the 2017 SemEval shared task on keyphrase extraction from scientific documents. We aimed at the creation of a keyphrase extraction approach which relies on as little external resources as possible. Without applying any hand-crafted external resources, and only utilizing a transformed version of word embeddings trained at Wikipedia, our proposed system manages to perform among the best participating systems in terms of precision.
