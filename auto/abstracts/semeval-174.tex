In this paper we report our attempt to use, on the one hand, state-of-the-art neural approaches that are proposed to measure Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). On the other hand, we propose an unsupervised cross-word alignment approach, which is linguistically motivated. The neural approaches proposed herein are divided into two main stages. The first stage deals with constructing neural word embeddings, the components of sentence embeddings. The second stage deals with constructing a semantic similarity function relating pairs of sentence embeddings. Unfortunately our competition results were poor in all tracks, therefore we concentrated our research to improve them for Track 5 (EN-EN).
