This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2017 shared task of determining question-question similarity in a community question-answering setting (Task 3B). We extracted both syntactic and semantic similarity features between candidate questions, performed pairwise-preference learning to optimize for ranking order, and then trained a random forest classifier to predict whether the candidate questions are paraphrases of each other. This approach achieved a MAP of 45.7\% out of max achievable 67.0\% on the test set.
