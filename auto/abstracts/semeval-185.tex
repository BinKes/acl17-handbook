This paper discusses the ``Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News'' task as part of SemEval-2017, specifically under the ``Detecting sentiment, humour, and truth'' theme. This task contains two tracks, where the first one concerns Microblog messages and the second one covers News Statements and Headlines. The main goal behind both tracks was to predict the sentiment score for each of the mentioned companies/stocks. The sentiment scores for each text instance adopted floating point values in the range of -1 (very negative/bearish) to 1 (very positive/bullish), with 0 designating neutral sentiment. This task attracted a total of 32 participants, with 25 participating in Track 1 and 29 in Track 2.
