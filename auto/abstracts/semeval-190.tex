This paper describes the system used by the team LIPN in SemEval 2017 Task 10: Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications. The team participated in Scenario 1, that includes three subtasks, Identification of keyphrases (Subtask A), Classification of identified keyphrases (Subtask B) and Extraction of relationships between two identified keyphrases (Subtask C). The presented system was mainly focused on the use of part-of-speech tag sequences to filter candidate keyphrases for Subtask A. Subtasks A and B were addressed as a sequence labeling problem using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and even though Subtask C was out of the scope of this approach, one rule was included to identify synonyms.
