In this paper we propose to solve the problem of Visual Question answering by using a novel segmentation guided attention based networks which we call SegAttendNet. We use image segmentation maps, generated by a Fully Convolutional Deep Neural Network to refine our attention maps and use these refined attention maps to make the model focus on the relevant parts of the image to answer a question. The refined attention maps are used by the LSTM network to learn to produce the answer. We presently train our model on the visual7W dataset and do a category wise evaluation of the 7 question categories. We achieve state of the art results on this dataset and beat the previous benchmark on this dataset by a 1.5\% margin improving the question answering accuracy from 54.1\% to 55.6\% and demonstrate improvements in each of the question categories. We also visualize our generated attention maps and note their improvement over the attention maps generated by the previous best approach.
