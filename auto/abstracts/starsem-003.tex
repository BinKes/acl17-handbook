We present a simple method for ever-growing extraction of predicate paraphrases from news headlines in Twitter. Analysis of the output of ten weeks of collection shows that the accuracy of paraphrases with different support levels is estimated between 60-86\%. We also demonstrate that our resource is to a large extent complementary to existing resources, providing many novel paraphrases. Our resource is publicly available, continuously expanding based on daily news.
