Recently, several datasets have become available which represent natural language phenomena as graphs. Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRL) have been the focus of much attention as a formalism to represent the graphs in these datasets. Chiang et al. (2013) prove that HRL graphs can be parsed in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input graph. We believe that HRL are more expressive than is necessary to represent semantic graphs and we propose the use of Regular Graph Languages (RGL; Courcelle 1991), which is a subfamily of HRL, as a possible alternative. We provide a top-down parsing algorithm for RGL that runs in time linear in the size of the input graph.
