The topics of mass and count have been studied for many decades in philosophy (e.g., Quine, 1960; Pelletier, 1975), linguistics (e.g., McCawley, 1975; Allen, 1980; Krifka, 1991) and psychology (e.g., Middleton et al, 2004; Barner et al, 2009).                          More recently, interest from within computational linguistics has studied the issues involved (e.g., Pustejovsky, 1991; Bond, 2005; Schmidtke \& Kuperman, 2016), to name just a few.  As is pointed out in these works, there are many difficult conceptual issues involved in the study of this contrast. In this article we study one of these issues -- the ``Dual-Life'' of being simultaneously +mass and +count -- by means of an unusual combination of human annotation, online lexical resources, and online corpora.
