WordNet has facilitated important research in natural language processing but its usefulness is somewhat limited by its relatively small lexical coverage. The Paraphrase Database (PPDB) covers 650 times more words, but lacks the semantic structure of WordNet that would make it more directly useful for downstream tasks. We present a method for mapping words from PPDB to WordNet synsets with 89\% accuracy. The mapping also lays important groundwork for incorporating WordNet's relations into PPDB so as to increase its utility for semantic reasoning in applications.
