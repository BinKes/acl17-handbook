Recognizing and distinguishing antonyms from other types of semantic relations is an essential part of language understanding systems. In this paper, we present a novel method for deriving antonym pairs using paraphrase pairs containing negation markers. We further propose a neural network model, AntNET, that integrates morphological features indicative of antonymy into a path-based relation detection algorithm. We demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in distinguishing antonyms from other semantic relations and is capable of efficiently handling multi-word expressions.
