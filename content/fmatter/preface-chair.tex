Welcome to ACL 2017 on Vancouver!  We hope you enjoy the conference and your
stay in Canada. Oh, Canada. Land of the free and home of the brave. Where no
one has proposed a Southern boarder wall and where science is still held in
high regard.  In fact, I believe that Prime Minister Trudeau has personally
proposed legislation to put a loonie in a special AI fund every time anyone
mentions the words ``deep learning''.  Anyway, what was I saying? Oh right,
welcome to ACL 2017!  

This year's program looks like it will be excellent!  We owe a huge thank you
to the Program Chairs, Regina Barzilay and Min-Yen Kan.  They selected this
year's papers from 1,318 submissions with the help of 44 area chairs and more
than 1,200 reviewers. Thanks to Regina, Min, the area chairs, the reviewers
and the authors. Beyond the papers, we have talks by luminaries in the field
of NLP, including ACL President Joakim Nivre, invited speakers Mirella 
apata and Noah Smith, and the recipient of this year's Lifetime Achievement
Award.  We also have an excellent set of workshops and tutorials. Thank you to
our workshop organizers and tutorial presenters. 

This year we are trying to make ACL more family friendly. We are offering
on-site subsidized childcare for the first time ever, plus a space for nursing
or pumping mothers. Our social event is at the aquarium, which promises to be
a family friendly venue. We hope you bring your loved ones with you.  

Enjoy the conference! I hope that you learn something new that inspires you to
push your own research to new heights.
