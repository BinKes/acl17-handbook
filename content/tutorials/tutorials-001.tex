  interest can be summed up as developing “AI for Precision Medicine“.

  {\bfseries Chris Quirk} is a researcher at Microsoft Research interested in
  semantic parsing, paraphrase methods, and very practical problems such as
  spelling correction and transliteration.

  {\bfseries Kristina Toutanova} is a researcher at Google Research.

  {\bfseries Wen-tau Yih} is a researcher in the Natural Language Processing
  Group. His primary research interest is natural language understanding, in
  particular solutions enabled by advanced machine learning models. Currently
  he is working on problems related to semantic parsing and question
  answering, as well as continuous-space semantic representations.

We will introduce precision medicine and showcase the vast opportunities for
NLP in this burgeoning field with great societal impact. We will review
pressing NLP problems, state-of-the art methods, and important applications,
as well as datasets, medical resources, and practical issues. The tutorial
will provide an accessible overview of biomedicine, and does not presume
knowledge in biology or healthcare. The ultimate goal is to reduce the entry
barrier for NLP researchers to contribute to this exciting domain.
