In the past decade, goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems have been the most
prominent component in today's virtual personal assistants. The classic
dialogue systems have rather complex and/or modular pipelines. The advance of
deep learning technologies has recently risen the applications of neural
models to dialogue modeling. However, how to successfully apply deep learning
based approaches to a dialogue system is still challenging. Hence, this
tutorial is designed to focus on an overview of the dialogue system
development while describing most recent research for building dialogue
systems and summarizing the challenges, in order to allow researchers to
study the potential improvements of the state-of-the-art dialogue systems. The
tutorial material is available at \url{http://deepdialogue.miulab.tw}.
