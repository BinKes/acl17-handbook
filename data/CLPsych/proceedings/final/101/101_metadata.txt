Abstract#==#In this paper, we use qualitative research methods to investigate the attitudes
of social media users towards the (opt-in) integration of social media data
with routine mental health care and diagnosis. Our investigation was based on
secondary analysis of a series of five focus groups with Twitter users,
including three groups consisting of participants with a self-reported history
of depression, and two groups consisting of participants without a self
reported history of depression. Our results indicate that, overall, research
participants were enthusiastic about the possibility of using social media (in
conjunction with automated Natural Language Processing algorithms) for mood
tracking under the supervision of a mental health practitioner. However, for at
least some participants, there was skepticism related to how well social media
represents the mental health of users, and hence its usefulness in the clinical
context.
