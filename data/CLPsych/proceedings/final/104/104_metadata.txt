Abstract#==#Previous investigations into detecting mental illnesses through social media
have predominately focused on detecting depression through Twitter corpora. In
this paper, we study anxiety disorders through personal narratives collected
through the popular social media website, Reddit. We build a substantial data
set of typical and anxiety-related posts, and we apply N-gram language
modeling, vector embeddings, topic analysis, and emotional norms to generate
features that accurately classify posts related to binary levels of anxiety. We
achieve an accuracy of 91% with vector-space word embeddings, and an accuracy
of 98% when combined with lexicon-based features.
