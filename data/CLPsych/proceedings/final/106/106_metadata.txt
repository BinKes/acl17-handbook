Abstract#==#Automatic detection of depression has attracted increasing attention from
researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, and related
disciplines. As a result, promising depression detection systems have been
reported. This paper surveys these efforts by presenting the first cross-modal
review of depression detection systems and discusses best practices and most
promising approaches to this task.
