Abstract#==#Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety-based disorder that affects
around 2.5% of the population. A common treatment for OCD is exposure therapy,
where the patient repeatedly confronts a feared experience, which has the
long-term effect of decreasing their anxiety. Some exposures consist of reading
and writing stories about an imagined anxiety-provoking scenario. In this
paper, we present a technology that enables patients to interactively
contribute to exposure stories by supplying natural language input (typed or
spoken) that advances a scenario. This interactivity could potentially increase
the patient's sense of immersion in an exposure and contribute to its success.
We introduce the NLP task behind processing inputs to predict new events in the
scenario, and describe our initial approach. We then illustrate the future
possibility of this work with an example of an exposure scenario authored with
our application.
