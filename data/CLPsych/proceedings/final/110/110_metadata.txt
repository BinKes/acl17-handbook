Abstract#==#We propose an automated system that can identify at-risk users from their
public social media activity, more specifically, from Twitter. The data that we
collected is from the #BellLetsTalk campaign, which is a wide-reaching,
multi-year program designed to break the silence around mental illness and
support mental health across Canada. To achieve our goal, we trained a
user-level classifier that can detect at-risk users that achieves a reasonable
precision and recall. We also trained a tweet-level classifier that predicts if
a tweet indicates depression. This task was much more difficult due to the
imbalanced data. In the dataset that we labeled, we came across 5% depression
tweets and 95% non-depression tweets. To handle this class imbalance, we used
undersampling methods. The resulting classifier had high recall, but low
precision. Therefore, we only use this classifier to compute the estimated
percentage of depressed tweets and to add this value as a feature for the
user-level classifier.
