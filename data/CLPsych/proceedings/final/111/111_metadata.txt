Abstract#==#Social connection and social isolation are associated with depressive symptoms,
particularly in adolescents and young adults, but how these concepts are
documented in clinical notes is unknown. This pilot study aimed to identify the
topics relevant to social connection and isolation by analyzing 145 clinical
notes from patients with depression diagnosis. We found that providers,
including physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists, document
descriptions of both social connection and social isolation.
