Abstract#==#Many psychological phenomena occur in small time windows, measured in minutes
or hours. However, most computational linguistic techniques look at data on the
order of weeks, months, or years. We explore micropatterns in sequences of
messages occurring over a short time window for their prevalence and power for
quantifying psychological phenomena, specifically, patterns in affect. We
examine affective micropatterns in social media posts from users with anxiety,
eating disorders, panic attacks, schizophrenia, suicidality, and matched
controls.
