Abstract#==#In this paper, we provide the first quantified exploration of the structure of
the language of dreams, their linguistic style and emotional content. We
present a collection of digital dream logs as a viable corpus for the growing
study of mental health through the lens of language, complementary to the work
done examining more traditional social media. This paper is largely
exploratory in nature to lay the groundwork for subsequent research in mental
health, rather than optimizing a particular text classification task.
