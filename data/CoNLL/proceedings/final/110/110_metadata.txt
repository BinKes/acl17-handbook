Abstract#==#We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic
role labeling.
Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on states of a
bidirectional LSTM encoder. 
The semantic role labeler achieves competitive performance on English, even
without any kind of syntactic information and only using local inference. 
However, when automatically predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as
input, it substantially outperforms all previous local models and approaches
the best reported results on the English CoNLL-2009 dataset. 
We also consider Chinese, Czech and Spanish where our approach also achieves
competitive results.
Syntactic parsers are unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e.,
syntactically-informed) SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. 
Our syntax-agnostic model appears more robust, resulting in the best reported
results on standard out-of-domain test sets.
