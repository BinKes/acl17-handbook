Abstract#==#We address the problem of cross-language adaptation for question-question
similarity reranking in community question answering, with the objective to
port a system trained on one input language to another input language given
labeled training data for the first language and only unlabeled data for the
second language.
In particular, we propose to use adversarial training of neural networks to
learn high-level features that are discriminative for the main learning task,
and at the same time are invariant across the input languages. The evaluation
results show sizable improvements for our cross-language adversarial neural
network (CLANN) model over a strong non-adversarial system.
