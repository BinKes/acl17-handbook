Abstract#==#Vector representations of word meaning have found many applications in the
field of natural language processing. Word vectors intuitively represent the
average context in which a given word tends to occur, but they cannot
explicitly model the diversity of these contexts. Although region
representations of word meaning offer a natural alternative to word vectors,
only few methods have been proposed that can effectively learn word regions. In
this paper, we propose a new word embedding model which is based on SVM
regression. We show that the underlying ranking interpretation of word contexts
is sufficient to match, and sometimes outperform, the performance of popular
methods such as Skip-gram. Furthermore, we show that by using a quadratic
kernel, we can effectively learn word regions, which outperform existing
unsupervised models for the task of hypernym detection.
