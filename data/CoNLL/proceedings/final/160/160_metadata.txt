Abstract#==#Understanding stories -- sequences of events -- is a crucial yet challenging
natural language understanding task. These events typically carry multiple
aspects of semantics including actions, entities and emotions. Not only does
each individual aspect contribute to the meaning of the story, so does the
interaction among these aspects.   
Building on this intuition, we propose to jointly model important aspects of
semantic knowledge -- frames, entities and sentiments -- via a semantic
language model. We achieve this by first representing these aspects' semantic
units at an appropriate level of abstraction and then using the resulting
vector representations for each semantic aspect to learn a joint representation
via a neural language model.
We show that the joint semantic language model is of high quality and can
generate better semantic sequences than models that operate on the word level.
We further demonstrate that our joint model can be applied to story cloze test
and shallow discourse parsing tasks with improved performance and that each
semantic aspect contributes to the model.
