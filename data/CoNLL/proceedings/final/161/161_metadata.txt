Abstract#==#Automatic summarisation is a popular approach to reduce a document to its main
arguments. Recent research in the area has focused on neural approaches to
summarisation, which can be very data-hungry. However, few large datasets exist
and none for the traditionally popular domain of scientific publications, which
opens up challenging research avenues centered on encoding large, complex
documents. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for summarisation of
computer science publications by exploiting a large resource of author provided
summaries and show straightforward ways of extending it further. We develop
models on the dataset making use of both neural sentence encoding and
traditionally used summarisation features and show that models which encode
sentences as well as their local and global context perform best, significantly
outperforming well-established baseline methods.
