Abstract#==#This paper presents a collaborative partitioning algorithm---a novel
ensemble-based approach to coreference resolution. Starting from the
all-singleton partition, we search for a solution close to the ensemble's
outputs in terms of a task-specific similarity measure. Our approach assumes a
loose integration of individual components of the ensemble and can therefore
combine arbitrary coreference resolvers, regardless of their models. 
Our experiments on the CoNLL dataset show that collaborative partitioning
yields results superior to those attained by the individual components, for
ensembles of both strong and weak systems. Moreover, by applying the
collaborative partitioning algorithm on top of three state-of-the-art
resolvers, we obtain the best coreference performance reported so far in the
literature (MELA v08 score of 64.47).
