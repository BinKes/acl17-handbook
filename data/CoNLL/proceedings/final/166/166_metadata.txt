Abstract#==#Arabic dialects do not just share a common koiné, but there are shared
pan-dialectal linguistic phenomena that allow computational models for dialects
to learn from each other. In this paper we build a unified segmentation model
where the training data for different dialects are combined and a single model
is trained. The model yields higher accuracies than dialect-specific models,
eliminating the need for dialect identification before segmentation. We also
measure the degree of relatedness between four major Arabic dialects by testing
how a segmentation model trained on one dialect performs on the other dialects.
We found that linguistic relatedness is contingent with geographical proximity.
In our experiments we use SVM-based ranking and bi-LSTM-CRF sequence labeling.
