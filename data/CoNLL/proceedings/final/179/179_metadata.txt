Abstract#==#We present a feature-rich knowledge tracing method that captures a student's
acquisition and retention of knowledge during a foreign language phrase
learning task. We model the student's behavior as making predictions under a
log-linear model, and adopt a neural gating mechanism to model how the student
updates their log-linear parameters in response to feedback.  The gating
mechanism allows the model to learn complex patterns of retention and
acquisition for each feature, while the log-linear parameterization results in
an interpretable knowledge state. We collect human data and evaluate several
versions of the model.
