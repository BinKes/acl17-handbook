Abstract#==#We introduce a neural network model that marries together ideas from two
prominent
strands of research on domain adaptation through representation learning:
structural correspondence learning (SCL, (Blitzer et al., 2006)) and
autoencoder neural networks (NNs). Our model is a three-layer NN that learns to
encode the non-pivot features of an input example into a low dimensional
representation, so that the existence of pivot features (features that are
prominent in both domains and convey useful information for the NLP task) in
the example can be decoded from that representation. The low-dimensional
representation is then employed in a learning algorithm for the task. Moreover,
we show how to inject pre-trained word embeddings into our model in order to
improve
generalization across examples with similar pivot features. We experiment with
the
task of cross-domain sentiment classification on 16 domain pairs and show
substantial improvements over strong baselines.
