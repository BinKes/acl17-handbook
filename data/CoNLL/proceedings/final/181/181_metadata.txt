Abstract#==#Metaphor detection has been both challenging and rewarding in natural language
processing applications. This study offers a new approach based on eventive
information in detecting metaphors by leveraging the Chinese writing system,
which is a culturally bound ontological system organized according to the basic
concepts represented by radicals. As such, the information represented is
available in all Chinese text without pre-processing. Since metaphor detection
is another culturally based conceptual representation, we hypothesize that
sub-textual information can facilitate the identification and classification of
the types of metaphoric events denoted in Chinese text. We propose a set of
syntactic conditions crucial to event structures to improve the model based on
the classification of radical groups. With the proposed syntactic conditions,
the model achieves a performance of 0.8859 in terms of F-scores, making 1.7% of
improvement than the same classifier with only Bag-of-word features. Results
show that eventive information can improve the effectiveness of metaphor
detection. Event information is rooted in every language, and thus this
approach has a high potential to be applied to metaphor detection in other
languages.
