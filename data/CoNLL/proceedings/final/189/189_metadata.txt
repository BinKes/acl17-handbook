Abstract#==#Tree kernels (TKs) and neural networks are two effective approaches for
automatic feature engineering. In this paper, we combine them by modeling
context word similarity in semantic TKs. This way, the latter can operate
subtree matching by applying neural-based similarity on tree lexical nodes. We
study how to learn representations for the words in context such that TKs can
exploit more focused information. We found that neural embeddings produced by
current methods do not provide a suitable contextual similarity. Thus, we
define a new approach based on a Siamese Network, which produces word
representations while learning a binary text similarity. We set the latter
considering examples in the same category as similar. The experiments on
question and sentiment classification show that our semantic TK highly improves
previous results.
