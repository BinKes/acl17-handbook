Abstract#==#Neural network models have recently been applied to the task of automatic essay
scoring, giving promising results. Existing work used recurrent neural networks
and convolutional neural networks to model input essays, giving grades based on
a single vector representation of the essay. On the other hand, the relative
advantages of RNNs and CNNs have not been compared. In addition, different
parts of the essay can contribute differently for scoring, which is not
captured by existing models. We ad- dress these issues by building a
hierarchical sentence-document model to represent essays, using the attention
mechanism to automatically decide the relative weights of words and sentences.
Results show that our model outperforms the previous state- of-the-art methods,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the attention mechanism.
