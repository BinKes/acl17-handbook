Abstract#==#We present a generative model of natural language sentences and demonstrate its
application to semantic parsing. In the generative process, a logical form
sampled from a prior, and conditioned on this logical form, a grammar
probabilistically generates the output sentence. Grammar induction using MCMC
is applied to learn the grammar given a set of labeled sentences with
corresponding logical forms. We develop a semantic parser that finds the
logical form with the highest posterior probability exactly. We obtain strong
results on the GeoQuery dataset and achieve state-of-the-art F1 on Jobs.
