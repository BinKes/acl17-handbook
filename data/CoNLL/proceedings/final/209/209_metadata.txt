Abstract#==#Pairwise ranking methods are the most widely used discriminative training
approaches for structure prediction problems in natural language processing
(NLP). Decomposing the problem of ranking hypotheses into pairwise comparisons
enables simple and efficient solutions. However, neglecting the global ordering
of the hypothesis list may hinder learning. We propose a listwise learning
framework for structure prediction problems such as machine translation. Our
framework directly models the entire translation listâ€™s ordering to learn
parameters which may better fit the given listwise samples. Furthermore, we
propose top-rank enhanced loss functions, which are more sensitive to ranking
errors at higher positions. Experiments on a large-scale Chinese-English
translation task show that both our listwise learning framework and top-rank
enhanced listwise losses lead to significant improvements in translation
quality.
