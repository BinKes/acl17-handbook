Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel approach to character identification, that is an
entity linking task that maps mentions to characters in dialogues from TV show
transcripts. We first augment and correct several cases of annotation errors in
an existing corpus so the corpus is clearer and cleaner for statistical
learning. We also introduce the agglomerative convolutional neural network that
takes groups of features and learns mention and mention-pair embeddings for
coreference resolution. We then propose another neural model that employs the
embeddings learned and creates cluster embeddings for entity linking. Our
coreference resolution model shows comparable results to other state-of-the-art
systems. Our entity linking model significantly outperforms the previous work,
showing the F1 score of 86.76% and the accuracy of 95.30% for character
identification.
