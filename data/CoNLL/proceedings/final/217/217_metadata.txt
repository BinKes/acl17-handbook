Abstract#==#Previous studies have shown that investor sentiment indicators can predict
stock market change.  A domain-specific sentiment lexicon and
sentiment-oriented word embedding model would help the sentiment analysis in
financial domain and stock market. In this paper, we present a new approach to
learning stock market lexicon from StockTwits, a popular financial social
network for investors to share ideas.  It learns word polarity by predicting
message sentiment, using a neural net-work.  The sentiment-oriented word
embeddings are learned from tens of millions of StockTwits posts, and this is
the first study presenting sentiment-oriented word embeddings for stock market.
 The experiments of predicting investor sentiment show that our lexicon
outperformed other lexicons built by the state-of-the-art methods, and the
sentiment-oriented word vector was much better than the general word
embeddings.
