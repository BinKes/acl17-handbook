Abstract#==#Extending semantic parsing systems to new domains and languages is a highly
expensive, time-consuming process, so making effective use of existing
resources is critical. In this paper, we describe a transfer learning method
using crosslingual word embeddings in a sequence-to-sequence model.  On the
NLmaps corpus, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.7% for
English.  Most importantly, we observed a consistent improvement for German
compared with several baseline domain adaptation techniques.  As a by-product
of this approach, our models that are trained on a combination of English and
German utterances perform reasonably well on code-switching utterances which
contain a mixture of English and German, even though the training data does not
contain any such. As far as we know, this is the first study of code-switching
in semantic parsing. We manually constructed the set of code-switching test 
utterances for the NLmaps corpus and achieve 78.3% accuracy on
