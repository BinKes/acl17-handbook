Abstract#==#Idea Density (ID) measures the rate at which ideas or elementary predications
are expressed in an utterance or in a text.
Lower ID is found to be associated with an increased risk of developing
Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Snowdon et al., 1996; Engelman et al., 2010).
ID has been used in two different versions: propositional idea density (PID)
counts the expressed ideas and can be applied to any text while semantic idea
density (SID) counts pre-defined information content units and is naturally
more applicable to normative domains, such as picture description tasks.
In this paper, we develop DEPID, a novel dependency-based method for computing
PID, and its version DEPID-R that enables to exclude repeating ideas---a
feature characteristic to AD speech.  We conduct the first comparison of
automatically extracted PID and SID in the diagnostic classification task on
two different AD datasets covering both closed-topic and free-recall domains. 
While SID performs better on the normative dataset, adding PID leads to a small
but significant improvement (+1.7 F-score). On the free-topic dataset, PID
performs better than SID as expected (77.6 vs 72.3 in F-score) but adding the
features derived from the word embedding clustering underlying the automatic
SID increases the results considerably, leading to an F-score of 84.8.
