Abstract#==#Topic models jointly learn topics and document-level topic
  distribution.  Extrinsic evaluation of topic models tends to focus
  exclusively on topic-level evaluation, e.g. by assessing the
  coherence of topics. We demonstrate that there can be large
  discrepancies between topic- and document-level model quality, and
  that basing model evaluation on topic-level analysis can be
  highly misleading.  We propose a method for automatically predicting
  topic model quality based on analysis of document-level topic
  allocations, and provide empirical evidence for its robustness.
