Abstract#==#Part-of-speech (POS) tagging for morphologically rich languages such as Arabic
is a challenging problem because of their enormous tag sets. One reason for
this is that in the tagging scheme for such languages, a complete POS tag is
formed by combining tags from multiple tag sets defined for each
morphosyntactic category. Previous approaches in Arabic POS tagging applied one
model for each morphosyntactic tagging task, without utilizing shared
information between the tasks. In this paper, we propose an approach that
utilizes this information by jointly modeling multiple morphosyntactic tagging
tasks with a multi-task learning framework. We also propose a method of
incorporating tag dictionary information into our neural models by combining
word representations with representations of the sets of possible tags. Our
experiments showed that the joint model with tag dictionary information results
in an accuracy of 91.38% on the Penn Arabic Treebank data set, with an absolute
improvement of 2.11% over the current state-of-the-art tagger.
