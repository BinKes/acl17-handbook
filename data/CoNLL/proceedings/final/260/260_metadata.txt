Abstract#==#This paper explores a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the
well-known Obligatory Contour Principle in phonology.  The purpose is twofold:
to see if such an algorithm could be used for unsupervised classification of
phonemes or graphemes in corpora, and to investigate whether this purported
universal constraint really holds for several classes of phonological
distinctive features.  The algorithm achieves very high accuracies in an
unsupervised setting of inferring a consonant-vowel distinction, and also has a
strong tendency to detect coronal phonemes in an unsupervised fashion.
Remaining classes, however, do not correspond as neatly to phonological
distinctive feature splits.  While the results offer only mixed support for a
universal Obligatory Contour Principle, the algorithm can be very useful for
many NLP tasks due to the high accuracy in revealing consonant/vowel/coronal
distinctions.
