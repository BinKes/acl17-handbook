Abstract#==#This paper is concerned with building deep grammatical relation (GR) analysis
using data-driven approach. To deal with this problem, we propose graph
merging, a new perspective, for building flexible dependency graphs:
Constructing complex graphs via constructing simple subgraphs. We discuss two
key problems in this perspective: (1) how to decompose a complex graph into
simple subgraphs, and (2) how to combine subgraphs into a coherent complex
graph. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of graph merging.
Our parser reaches state-of-the-art performance and is significantly better
than two transition-based parsers.
