Abstract#==#Recent work has explored the syntactic abilities of RNNs using the subject-verb
agreement task, which diagnoses sensitivity to sentence structure. RNNs
performed this task well in common cases, but faltered in complex sentences
(Linzen et al., 2016). We test whether these errors are due to inherent
limitations of the architecture or to the relatively indirect supervision
provided by most agreement dependencies in a corpus. We trained a single RNN to
perform both the agreement task and an additional task, either CCG supertagging
or language modeling. Multi-task training led to significantly lower error
rates, in particular on complex sentences, suggesting that RNNs have the
ability to evolve more sophisticated syn- tactic representations than shown
before. We also show that easily available agreement training data can improve
performance on other syntactic tasks, in particular when only a limited amount
of training data is available for those tasks. The multi-task paradigm can also
be leveraged to inject grammatical knowledge into language models.
