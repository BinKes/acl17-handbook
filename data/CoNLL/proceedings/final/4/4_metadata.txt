Abstract#==#This paper is concerned with whether
deep syntactic information can help surface parsing, with a particular focus on
empty categories. We design new algorithms to produce dependency trees in
which empty elements are allowed, and
evaluate the impact of information about
empty category on parsing overt elements.
Such information is helpful to reduce the
approximation error in a structured parsing model, but increases the search
space
for inference and accordingly the estimation error. To deal with
structure-based
overfitting, we propose to integrate disambiguation models with and without
empty
elements, and perform structure regularization via joint decoding. Experiments
on
English and Chinese TreeBanks with different parsing models indicate that
incorporating empty elements consistently improves surface parsing.
