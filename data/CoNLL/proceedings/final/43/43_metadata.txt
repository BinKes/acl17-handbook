Abstract#==#We address the task of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) for noisy text. 
We present WikilinksNED, a large-scale NED dataset of text fragments from the
web, which is significantly noisier and more challenging than existing
news-based datasets. To capture the limited and noisy local context surrounding
each mention, we design a neural model and train it with a novel method for
sampling informative negative examples. We also describe a new way of
initializing word and entity embeddings that significantly improves
performance. Our model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on WikilinksNED while achieving comparable performance on a smaller
newswire
dataset.
