Abstract#==#For many applications of question answering (QA), being able to explain why a
given model chose an answer is critical.  However, the lack of labeled data for
 answer justifications makes learning this difficult and expensive.  Here we
propose an approach that uses answer ranking as distant supervision for
learning how to select informative justifications, where justifications serve
as inferential connections between the question and the correct answer while
often containing little lexical overlap with either.
We propose a neural network architecture for QA that reranks answer
justifications as an intermediate (and human-interpretable) step in answer
selection. Our approach is informed by a set of features designed to combine
both learned representations and explicit features to capture the connection
between questions, answers, and answer justifications.
 We show that with this end-to-end approach we are able to significantly
improve upon a strong IR baseline in both justification ranking (+9% rated
highly relevant) and answer selection (+6% P@1).
