Abstract#==#The task of relation classification in the biomedical domain is complex due to
the presence of samples obtained from heterogeneous sources such as research
articles, discharge summaries, or electronic health records. It is also a
constraint for classifiers which employ manual feature engineering. In this
paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture
that combines RNNs and CNNs in sequence to solve this problem. The rationale
behind our approach is that CNNs can effectively identify coarse-grained local
features in a sentence, while RNNs are more suited for long-term dependencies.
We compare our CRNN model with several baselines on two biomedical datasets,
namely the i2b2-2010 clinical relation extraction challenge dataset, and the
SemEval-2013 DDI extraction dataset. We also evaluate an attentive pooling
technique and report its performance in comparison with the conventional max
pooling method. Our results indicate that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.
