Abstract#==#This paper proposes a matching technique for learning causal associations
between word features and class labels in document classification. The goal is
to identify more meaningful and generalizable features than with only
correlational approaches. Experiments with sentiment classification show that
the proposed method identifies interpretable word associations with sentiment
and improves classification performance in a majority of cases. The proposed
feature selection method is particularly effective when applied to
out-of-domain data.
