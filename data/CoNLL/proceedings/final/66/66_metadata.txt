Abstract#==#This paper is concerned with identifying contexts useful for training word
representation models for different word classes such as adjectives (A), verbs
(V), and nouns (N). We introduce a simple yet effective framework for an
automatic selection of class-specific context configurations. We construct a
context configuration space based on universal dependency relations between
words, and efficiently search this space with an adapted beam search algorithm.
In word similarity tasks for each word class, we show that our framework is
both effective and efficient. Particularly, it improves the Spearman's rho
correlation with human scores on SimLex-999 over the best previously proposed
class-specific contexts by 6 (A), 6 (V) and 5 (N) rho points. With our selected
context configurations, we train on only 14% (A), 26.2% (V), and 33.6% (N) of
all dependency-based contexts, resulting in a reduced training time. Our
results generalise: we show that the configurations our algorithm learns for
one English training setup outperform previously proposed context types in
another training setup for English. Moreover, basing the configuration space on
universal dependencies, it is possible to transfer the learned configurations
to German and Italian. We also demonstrate improved per-class results over
other context types in these two languages..
