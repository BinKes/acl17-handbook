Abstract#==#We propose a neural multi-document summarization system that incorporates
sentence relation graphs.
We employ a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the relation graphs, with
sentence embeddings obtained from Recurrent Neural Networks as input node
features.
Through multiple layer-wise propagation, the GCN generates high-level hidden
sentence features for salience estimation.
We then use a greedy heuristic to extract salient sentences that avoid
redundancy.
In our experiments on DUC 2004, we consider three types of sentence relation
graphs and demonstrate the advantage of combining sentence relations in graphs
with the representation power of deep neural networks.
Our model improves upon other traditional graph-based extractive approaches and
the vanilla GRU sequence model with no graph, and it achieves competitive
results against other state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems.
