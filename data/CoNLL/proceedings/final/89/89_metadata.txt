Abstract#==#Question answering (QA) systems are easily  distracted by  irrelevant or 
redundant words in questions, especially when faced with  long                       
  or 
multi-sentence                          questions  in difficult  domains. This       
     
paper 
introduces and
 studies  the  notion  of essential  question  terms with  the goal  of 
improving such QA  solvers. We                          illustrate the             
importance            of               
  essential 
question  terms  by showing  that  humansâ€™  ability  to  answer questions
drops significantly when essential  terms  are eliminated  from  questions.We
then develop a classifier that reliably (90%  mean  average  precision) 
identifies and ranks essential terms in questions. Finally, we use the
classifier to demonstrate that                          the  notion  of  question 
term 
essentiality 
allows state-of-the-art  QA  solver for  elementary-level  science  questions 
to make better and more informed decisions,improving performance by up to 5%.We
 also  introduce  a  new  dataset  of  over 2,200 crowd-sourced essential terms
annotated science questions.
