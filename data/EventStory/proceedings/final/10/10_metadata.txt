Abstract#==#Recent studies have shown that word embedding models can be used to trace
time-related (diachronic) semantic shifts in particular words. In this paper,
we evaluate some of these approaches on the new task of predicting the dynamics
of global armed conflicts on a year-to-year basis, using a dataset from the
conflict research field as the gold standard and the Gigaword news corpus as
the training data. The results show that much work still remains in extracting
`cultural' semantic shifts from diachronic word embedding models. At the same
time, we present a new task complete with an evaluation set and introduce the
`anchor words' method which outperforms previous approaches on this set.
