Abstract#==#Storyline research links together events in stories and specifies shared
participants in those stories. In these analyses, an atomic event is assumed to
be a single clause headed by a single verb. However, many analyses of verbal
semantics assume a decompositional analysis of events expressed in single
clauses. We present a formalization of a decompositional analysis of events in
which each participant in a clausal event has their own temporally extended
subevent, and the subevents are related through causal and other interactions.
This decomposition allows us to represent storylines as an evolving set of
interactions between participants over time.
