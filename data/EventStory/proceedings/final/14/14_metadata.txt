Abstract#==#We present an approach at identifying a specific class of events, movement
action events (MAEs), in a data set that consists of ca. 2,800 personal letters
exchanged by the German architect Erich Mendelsohn and his wife, Luise. A
backend system uses these and other semantic analysis results as input for an
authoring environment that digital curators can use to produce new pieces of
digital content. In our example case, the human expert will receive
recommendations from the system with the goal of putting together a travelogue,
i.e., a description of the trips and journeys undertaken by the couple. We
describe the components and architecture and also apply the system to news
data.
