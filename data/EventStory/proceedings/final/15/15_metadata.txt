Abstract#==#This paper reports on an effort of creating a corpus of structured information
on security-related events automatically extracted from on-line news, part of
which has been manually curated. The main motivation behind this effort is to
provide material to the NLP community working on event extraction that could be
used both for training and evaluation purposes.
