Abstract#==#Event knowledge represents the knowledge of causal and temporal relations
between events. Shared arguments of event knowledge encode patterns of role
shifting in successive events. A two-stage framework was proposed for the task
of Japanese event knowledge acquisition, 
in which related event pairs are first extracted, and shared arguments are then
identified to form the complete event knowledge. This paper focuses on the
second stage of this framework, and proposes a method to improve the shared
argument identification of related event pairs. We constructed a gold dataset
for shared argument learning. By evaluating our system on this gold dataset, we
found that our proposed model outperformed the baseline models by a large
margin.
