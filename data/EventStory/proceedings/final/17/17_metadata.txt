Abstract#==#Recent methods for Event Detection focus on Deep Learning for automatic feature
generation and feature ranking. However, most of those approaches fail to
exploit rich semantic information, which results in relatively poor recall.
This paper is a small & focused contribution, where we introduce an Event
Detection and classification system, based on deep semantic information
retrieved from a frame-semantic parser. Our experiments show that our system
achieves higher recall than state-of-the-art systems. Further, we claim that
enhancing our system with deep learning techniques like feature ranking can
achieve even better results, as it can benefit from both approaches.
