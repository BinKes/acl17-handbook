Abstract#==#Human understanding of narrative is mainly driven by reasoning about causal
relations between events and thus recognizing them is a key capability for
computational models of language understanding. Computational work in this area
has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a
knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to
understand a particular story or macro-event, along
with its storyline. In this position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition
approach and claim that newswire is a relatively poor source for learning
fine-grained causal relations between everyday events. We describe experiments
using an unsupervised method to learn causal relations between events in the
narrative genres of first-person narratives and film
scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal
relations,
judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80% of the time. We also
demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available
event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.
