Abstract#==#We propose a method to aggregate and organize a large, multi-source dataset of
news articles into a collection of major stories, and automatically name and
visualize these stories in a working system. The approach is able to run
online, as new articles are added, processing 4 million news articles from 20
news sources, and extracting 80000 major stories, some of which span several
years. The visual interface consists of lanes of timelines, each annotated with
information that is deemed important for the story, including extracted
quotations. The working system allows a user to search and navigate 8 years of
story information.
