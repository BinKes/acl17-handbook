Abstract#==#This paper reports on the Event StoryLine Corpus (ESC) v1.0, a new benchmark
dataset for the temporal and causal relation detection. By developing this
dataset, we also introduce a new task, the StoryLine Extraction from news data,
which aims at extracting and classifying events relevant for stories, from
across news documents spread in time and clustered around a single seminal
event or topic. In addition to describing the dataset, we also report on three
baselines systems whose results show the complexity of the task and suggest
directions for the development of more robust systems.
