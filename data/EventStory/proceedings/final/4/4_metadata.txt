Abstract#==#Detecting events from social media data has important applications in public
security, political issues, and public health. Many studies have focused on
detecting specific or unspecific events from Twitter streams. However, not much
attention has been paid to detecting changes, and their impact, in online
conversations related to an event. We propose methods for detecting such
changes, using clustering of temporal profiles of hashtags, and three change
point detection algorithms. The methods were tested on two Twitter datasets:
one covering the 2014 Ottawa shooting event, and one covering the Sochi winter
Olympics. We compare our approach to a baseline consisting of detecting change
from raw counts in the conversation. We show that our method produces large
gains in change detection accuracy on both datasets.
