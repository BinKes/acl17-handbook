Abstract#==#With growing interest in automated event extraction, there is an increasing
need to overcome the labor costs of hand-written event templates, entity lists,
and annotated corpora. In the last few years, more inductive approaches have
emerged, seeking to discover unknown event types and roles in raw text. The
main recent efforts use probabilistic generative models, as in topic modeling,
which are formally concise but do not always yield stable or easily
interpretable results. We argue that event schema induction can benefit from
greater structure in the process and in linguistic features that distinguish
words' functions and themes. To maximize our use of limited data, we reverse
the typical schema induction steps and introduce new similarity measures,
building an intuitive process for inducing the structure of unknown events.
