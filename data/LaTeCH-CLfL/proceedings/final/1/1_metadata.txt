Abstract#==#The post-modern novel “Wittgenstein’s Mistress” by David Markson (1988)
presents the reader with a very challenging non-linear narrative, that itself
appears to one of the novel’s themes. We present a distant reading of this
work designed to complement a close reading of it by David Foster Wallace
(1990).   Using a combination of text analysis, entity recognition and
networks, we plot repetitive structures in the novel’s narrative relating
them to its critical analysis.
