Abstract#==#The last decade saw a surge in digitisation efforts for ancient manuscripts in
Sanskrit. Due to various linguistic peculiarities inherent to the language,
even the preliminary tasks such as word segmentation are non-trivial in
Sanskrit. Elegant models for Word Segmentation in Sanskrit are indispensable
for further syntactic and semantic processing of the manuscripts. Current works
in word segmentation for Sanskrit, though commendable in their novelty, often
have variations in their objective and evaluation criteria. In this work, we
set the record straight. We formally define the objectives and the requirements
for the word segmentation task. In order to encourage research in the field and
to alleviate the time and effort required in pre-processing, we release a
dataset of 115,000 sentences for word segmentation. For each sentence in the
dataset we include the input character sequence, ground truth segmentation, and
additionally lexical and morphological information about all the phonetically
possible segments for the given sentence. In this work, we also discuss the
linguistic considerations made while generating the candidate space of the
possible segments.
