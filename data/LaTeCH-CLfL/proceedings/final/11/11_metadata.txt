Abstract#==#This paper presents a newly funded international project for machine
translation and automated analysis of ancient cuneiform languages where NLP
specialists and Assyriologists collaborate to create an information retrieval
system for Sumerian. This research is conceived in response to the need to
translate large numbers of administrative texts that are only available in
transcription, in order to make them accessible to a wider audience. The
methodology includes creation of a specialized NLP pipeline and also the use of
linguistic linked open data to increase access to the results.
