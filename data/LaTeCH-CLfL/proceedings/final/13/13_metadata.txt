Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach to extract co-occurrence networks from literary
texts. It is a deliberate decision not to aim for a fully automatic pipeline,
as the literary research questions need to guide both the definition of the
nature of the things that co-occur as well as how to decide co-occurrence. We
showcase the approach on a Middle High German romance, \parz. Manual inspection
and discussion shows the huge impact various choices  have.
