Abstract#==#We present a data-driven approach to investigate
intra-textual variation by combining
entropy and surprisal. With this
approach we detect linguistic variation
based on phrasal lexico-grammatical patterns
across sections of research articles.
Entropy is used to detect patterns typical
of specific sections. Surprisal is used
to differentiate between more and less
informationally-loaded patterns as well as
type of information (topical vs. stylistic).
While we here focus on research articles in
biology/genetics, the methodology is especially
interesting for digital humanities
scholars, as it can be applied to any text
type or domain and combined with additional
variables (e.g. time, author or social
group).
