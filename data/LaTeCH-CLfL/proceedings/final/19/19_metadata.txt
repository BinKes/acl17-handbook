Abstract#==#We investigate in this paper the problem of classifying the stylome of
characters in a literary work. Previous research in the field of authorship
attribution has shown that the writing style of an author can be characterized
and distinguished from that of other authors automatically. In this paper we
take a look at the less approached problem of how the styles of different
characters can be distinguished, trying to verify if an author managed to
create believable characters with individual styles. We present the results of
some initial experiments developed on the novel "Liaisons Dangereuses", showing
that a
simple bag of words model can be used to classify the characters.
