Abstract#==#Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of
poetry, giving rise to different stylistic effects. In Spanish literary
studies, there are unclear points about the types of stylistic effects that can
arise, and under which linguistic conditions. To systematically gather evidence
about this, we developed a system to automatically identify enjambment (and its
type) in Spanish. For evaluation, we manually annotated a reference corpus
covering different periods. As a scholarly corpus to apply the tool, from
public HTML sources we created a diachronic corpus covering four centuries of
sonnets (3750 poems), and we analyzed the occurrence of enjambment across
stanzaic boundaries in different periods. Besides, we found examples that
highlight limitations in current definitions of enjambment.
