Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our preliminary
study on an ontology-based method to extract
and classify compositional nominal
compounds in specific domains of knowledge.
This method is based on the assumption
that, applying a conceptual model to
represent knowledge domain, it is possible
to improve the extraction and classification
of lexicon occurrences for that domain
in a semi-automatic way. We explore
the possibility of extracting and classifying
a specific construction type (nominal
compounds) spanning a specific domain
(Cultural Heritage) and a specific
language (Italian).
