Abstract#==#In this paper, we present ongoing work for developing language resources and
basic NLP tools for an undocumented variety of Romansh, in the context of a
language documentation and language acquisition project. Our tools are meant to
improve the speed and reliability of corpus annotations for noisy data
involving large amounts of code-switching, occurrences of child-speech and
orthographic noise. Being able to increase the efficiency of language resource
development for language documentation and acquisition research also
constitutes a step towards solving the data sparsity issues with which
researchers have been struggling.
