Abstract#==#Language processing architectures are often evaluated in near-to-perfect
conditions with respect to processed content. The tools which perform
sufficiently well on electronic press, books and other type of non-interactive
content may poorly handle littered, colloquial and multilingual textual data
which make the majority of communication today. This paper aims at
investigating how Polish Twitter data (in a slightly controlled `political'
flavour) differs from expectation of linguistic tools and how they could be
corrected to be ready for processing by standard language processing chains
available for Polish. The setting includes specialised components for spelling
correction of tweets as well as hashtag and username decoding.
