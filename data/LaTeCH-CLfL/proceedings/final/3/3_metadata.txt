Abstract#==#Metaphor is indispensable in poetry. It showcases the poet's creativity, and
contributes to the overall emotional pertinence of the poem while honing its
specific rhetorical impact. Previous work on metaphor detection relies on
either rule-based or statistical models, none of them applied to poetry. Our
method focuses on metaphor detection in a poetry corpus. It combines rule-based
and statistical models (word embeddings) to develop a new classification
system. Our system has achieved a precision of 0.759 and a recall of 0.804 in
identifying one type of metaphor in poetry.
