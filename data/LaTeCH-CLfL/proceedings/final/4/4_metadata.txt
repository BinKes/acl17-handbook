Abstract#==#In this paper, we present the annotation challenges we have encountered when
working on a historical language that was undergoing elaboration processes. We
especially focus on syntactic ambiguity and gradience in Middle Low German,
which causes uncertainty to some extent. Since current annotation tools
consider construction contexts and the dynamics of the grammaticalization only
partially, we plan to extend CorA - a web-based annotation tool for historical
and other non-standard language data - to capture elaboration phenomena and
annotator unsureness. Moreover, we seek to interactively learn morphological as
well as syntactic annotations.
