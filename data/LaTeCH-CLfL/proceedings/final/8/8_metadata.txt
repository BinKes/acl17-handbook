Abstract#==#The oral component of medieval poetry was integral to its performance and
reception. Yet many believe that the medieval voice has been forever lost, and
any attempts at rediscovering it are doomed to failure due to scribal
practices, manuscript mouvance, and linguistic normalization in editing
practices. This paper offers a method to abstract from this noise and better
understand relative differences in phonological soundscapes by considering
syllable qualities. The presented syllabification method and soundscape
analysis offer themselves as cross-disciplinary tools for low-resource
languages. As a case study, we examine medieval German lyric and argue that the
heavily debated lyrical ‘I’ follows a unique trajectory through
soundscapes, shedding light on the performance and practice of these poets.
