Abstract#==#In this paper we present a set of experiments and analyses on predicting gender
of Twitter users based on language-independent features extracted either from
the text or the metadata of users' tweets. We perform our experiments on the
TwiSty dataset containing manual gender annotations for users speaking six
different languages. Our classification results show that, while the prediction
model based on language-independent features performs worse than the
bag-of-words model when training and testing on the same language, it regularly
outperforms the bag-of-words model when applied to different languages, showing
very stable results across various languages. Finally we perform a comparative
analysis of feature effect sizes across the six languages and show that
differences in our features correspond to cultural distances.
