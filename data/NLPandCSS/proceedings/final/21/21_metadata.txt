Abstract#==#Research in Social Science is usually based on survey data where individual
research questions relate to observable concepts (variables). However, due to a
lack of standards for data citations a reliable identification of the variables
used is often difficult. In this paper, we present a work-in-progress study
that seeks to provide a solution to the variable detection task based on
supervised machine learning algorithms, using a linguistic analysis pipeline to
extract a rich feature set, including terminological concepts and similarity
metric scores.
Further, we present preliminary results on a small dataset that has been
specifically designed for this task, yielding
a significant increase in performance over the random baseline.
