Abstract#==#There has been a long standing interest in understanding `Social Influence'
both in Social Sciences and in Computational Linguistics. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to study and measure interpersonal influence in daily
interactions. Motivated by the basic principles of influence, we attempt to
identify indicative linguistic features of the posts in an online knitting
community. We present the scheme used to operationalize and label the posts as
influential or non-influential. Experiments with the identified features show
an improvement in the classification accuracy of influence by 3.15\%. Our
results illustrate the important correlation between the structure of the
language and its potential to influence others.
