Abstract#==#Previous work on classifying Twitter users' political alignment has mainly
focused on lexical and social network features. This study provides evidence
that political affiliation is also reflected in features which have been
previously overlooked: users' discourse patterns (proportion of Tweets that are
retweets or replies) and their rate of use of capitalization and punctuation.
We find robust differences between politically left- and right-leaning
communities with respect to these discourse and sub-lexical features, although
they are not enough to train a high-accuracy classifier.
