Abstract#==#Personality plays a decisive role in how people behave in different scenarios,
including online social media. Researchers have used such data to study how
personality can be predicted from language use. In this paper, we study phrase
choice as a particular stylistic linguistic difference, as opposed to the
mostly topical differences identified previously. Building on previous work on
demographic preferences, we quantify differences in paraphrase choice from a
massive Facebook data set with posts from over 115,000 users. We quantify the
predictive power of phrase choice in user profiling and use phrase choice to
study psycholinguistic hypotheses. This work is relevant to future applications
that aim to personalize text generation to specific personality types.
