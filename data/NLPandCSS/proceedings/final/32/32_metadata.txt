Abstract#==#We explore a novel computational approach for analyzing member participation in
small group social sequences. Using a complex state representation combining
information about dialogue act types, sentiment expression, and participant
roles, we explore which sequence states are associated with high levels of
member participation. Using a Markov Rewards framework, we associate particular
states with immediate positive and negative rewards, and employ a Value
Iteration algorithm to calculate the expected value of all states. In our
findings, we focus on discourse states belonging to team leaders and project
managers which are either very likely or very unlikely to lead to participation
from the rest of the group members.
