Abstract#==#Code-switching has been found to have social motivations in addition to
syntactic constraints.
In this work, we explore the social effect of code-switching in an online
community.
We present a task from the Arabic Wikipedia to capture language choice, in this
case code-switching between Arabic and other languages, as a predictor of
social influence in collaborative editing.
We find that code-switching is positively associated with Wikipedia editor
success, particularly borrowing technical language on pages with topics less
directly related to Arabic-speaking regions.
