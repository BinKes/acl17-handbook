Abstract#==#Demographically-tagged social media messages are a common source of data for
computational social science.  While these messages can indicate differences in
beliefs and behaviors between demographic groups, we do not have a clear
understanding of how different demographic groups use platforms such as
Twitter.  This paper presents a preliminary analysis of how groups' differing
behaviors may confound analyses of the groups themselves.  We analyzed one
million Twitter users by first inferring demographic attributes, and then
measuring several indicators of Twitter behavior. We find differences in these
indicators across demographic groups, suggesting that there may be underlying
differences in how different demographic groups use Twitter.
