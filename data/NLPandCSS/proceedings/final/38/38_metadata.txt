Abstract#==#Politicians carefully word their statements in order to influence how others
view an issue, a political strategy called framing. Simultaneously, these
frames may also reveal the beliefs or positions on an issue of the politician.
Simple language features such as unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams are important
indicators for identifying the general frame of a text, for both longer
congressional speeches and shorter tweets of politicians. However, tweets may
contain multiple unigrams across different frames which limits the
effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, we present a joint model which
uses both linguistic features of tweets and ideological phrase indicators
extracted from a state-of-the-art embedding-based model to predict the general
frame of political tweets.
