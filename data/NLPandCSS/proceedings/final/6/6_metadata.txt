Abstract#==#Vector embeddings of words have been shown to encode meaningful semantic
relationships that enable solving of complex analogies. This vector embedding
concept has been extended successfully to many different domains and in this
paper we both create and visualize vector representations of an unstructured
collection of online communities based on user participation. Further, we
quantitatively and qualitatively show that these representations allow solving
of semantically meaningful community analogies and also other more general
types of relationships. These results could help improve community
recommendation engines and also serve as a tool for sociological studies of
community relatedness.
