Abstract#==#In this paper, we evaluate the predictability of tweets associated with
controversial versus non-controversial topics. As a first step, we
crowd-sourced the scoring of a predefined set of topics on a Likert scale from
non-controversial to controversial. Our feature set entails and goes beyond
sentiment features, e.g., by leveraging empathic language and other features
that have been previously used but are new for this particular study. We find
focusing on the structural characteristics of tweets to be beneficial for this
task. Using a combination of emphatic, language-specific, and Twitter-specific
features for supervised learning resulted in 87% accuracy (F1) for
cross-validation of the training set and 63.4% accuracy when using the test
set. Our analysis shows that features specific to Twitter or social media, in
general, are more prevalent in tweets on controversial topics than in
non-controversial ones. To test the premise of the paper, we conducted two
additional sets of experiments, which led to mixed results. This finding will
inform our future investigations into the relationship between language use on
social media and the perceived controversiality of topics.
