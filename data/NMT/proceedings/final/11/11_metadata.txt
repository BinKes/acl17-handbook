Abstract#==#Training of neural machine translation (NMT) models usually uses mini-batches
for efficiency purposes.
During the mini-batched training process, it is necessary to pad shorter
sentences in a mini-batch to be equal in length to the longest sentence therein
for efficient computation.
Previous work has noted that sorting the corpus based on the sentence length
before making mini-batches reduces the amount of padding and increases the
processing speed.
However, despite the fact that mini-batch creation is an essential step in NMT
training, widely used NMT toolkits implement disparate strategies for doing so,
which have not been empirically validated or compared.
This work investigates mini-batch creation strategies with experiments over two
different datasets.
Our results suggest that the choice of a mini-batch creation strategy has a
large effect on NMT training and some length-based sorting strategies do not
always work well compared with simple shuffling.
