Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation technique for neural machine
translation called cost weighting, which is appropriate for adaptation
scenarios in which a small in-domain data set and a large general-domain data
set are available. Cost weighting incorporates a domain classifier into the
neural machine translation training algorithm, using features derived from the
encoder representation in order to distinguish in-domain from out-of-domain
data. Classifier probabilities are used to weight sentences according to their
domain similarity when updating the parameters of the neural translation model.
We compare cost weighting to two traditional domain adaptation techniques
developed for statistical machine translation: data selection and sub-corpus
weighting. Experiments on two large-data tasks show that both the traditional
techniques and our novel proposal lead to significant gains, with cost
weighting outperforming the traditional methods.
