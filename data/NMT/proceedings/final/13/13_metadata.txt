Abstract#==#Despite its promise, neural machine translation (NMT) has a serious problem in
that source content may be mistakenly left untranslated. The ability to detect
untranslated content is important for the practical use of NMT. We evaluate two
types of probability with which to detect untranslated content: the cumulative
attention (ATN) probability and back translation (BT) probability from the
target sentence to the source sentence. Experiments on detecting untranslated
content in Japanese-English patent translations show that ATN and BT are each
more effective than random choice, BT is more effective than ATN, and the
combination of the two provides further improvements. We also confirmed the
effectiveness of using ATN and BT to rerank the n-best NMT outputs.
