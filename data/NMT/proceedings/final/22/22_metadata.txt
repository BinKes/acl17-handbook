Abstract#==#Chat systems have increasingly grown in importance with the widespread use of
technology. This has spurred the development of open-domain dialog systems
through neural models. These focus on generating long, relevant and informative
responses to user queries. We present a novel approach to build a domain-aware
neural dialog system to achieve the same. Our approach is based on the
observation that each utterance in a conversation lies in a specific domain,
the shift in domains is smooth and that the context in a conversation plays a
vital role in deciding the response. To incorporate this observation, we
propose two domain-aware models : a non-neural ensemble and a recurrent neural
network based model that together with domain-specific sequence-to-sequence
models generate pertinent responses. We evaluate these models on automatic
metrics and compare the results to that of the Seq2Seq model. This is a
submission to the extended abstract track.
