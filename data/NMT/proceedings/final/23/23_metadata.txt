Abstract#==#Parallel corpora are often not as parallel as one might assume: non-literal
translations and noisy translations abound, even in curated corpora routinely
used for training and evaluation. We use a cross-lingual textual entailment
system to distinguish sentence pairs that are parallel in meaning from those
that are not, and show that filtering out divergent examples from training
improves translation quality.
