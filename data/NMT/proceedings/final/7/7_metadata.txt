Abstract#==#While neural machine translation has been
successful due to significantly better translation
quality, it is hard to understand how
and why such translation has been generated.
To help the analysis, we propose an
interactive beam search decoder, a webbased
tool for visualizing and analyzing
decoder behavior. We also propose methods
and tool interfaces to modify attention
layer of decoder and to observe its corresponding
change. Finally, we show preliminary
analysis of NMT behavior found
with the tool we propose.

This is a submission to the extended abstract track.
