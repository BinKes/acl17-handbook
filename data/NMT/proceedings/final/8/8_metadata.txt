Abstract#==#We present a simple and effective approach to incorporating syntactic structure
into NMT  using graph-convolutional networks (GCNs). GCNs can produce
representations of words that are sensitive to their syntactic neighborhoods.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on English-German and
English-Czech translation tasks for different types of encoders and observe
+1.2 and +0.7 BLEU point improvements, respectively, from using syntactic GCNs
on top of BiRNNs.

This is a submission to the extended abstract track.
