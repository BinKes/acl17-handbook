Abstract#==#A significant number of neural architectures for reading comprehension have
recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets.
  We present experiments supporting the emergence of "predication structure" in
the hidden state vectors of these readers.  More specifically, we provide
evidence that the hidden state vectors represent atomic formulas $\Phi[c]$
where $\Phi$ is a semantic property (predicate) and $c$ is a constant symbol
entity identifier.
