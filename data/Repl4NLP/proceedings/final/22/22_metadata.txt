Abstract#==#Coreference resolution task demands comprehending a discourse, especially for
anaphoric mentions which require semantic information for resolving
antecedents. We investigate into how memory networks can be helpful for
coreference resolution when posed as question answering problem. The
comprehension capability of memory networks assists coreference resolution,
particularly for the mentions that require semantic and context information. We
experiment memory networks for coreference resolution, with 4 synthetic
datasets generated for coreference resolu- tion with varying difficulty levels.
Our systemâ€™s performance is compared with a traditional coreference
resolution system to show why memory network can be promising for coreference
resolution.
