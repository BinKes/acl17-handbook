Abstract#==#Word representation models have achieved great success in natural language
processing tasks, such as relation classification. However, it does not always
work on informal text, and the morphemes of some misspelling  words may carry
important short-distance semantic information.
We propose a hybrid model, combining the merits of word-level and
character-level representations to learn better representations on informal
text. 
Experiments on two dataset of relation classification, SemEval-2010 Task8 and a
large-scale one we compile from informal text, show that our model achieves a
competitive result in the former and state-of-the-art with the other.
