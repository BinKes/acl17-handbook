Abstract#==#Recent studies on knowledge base completion, the task of recovering missing
relationships based on recorded relations, demonstrate the importance of
learning embeddings from multi-step relations. However, due to the size of
knowledge bases, learning multi-step relations directly on top of observed
triplets could be costly. Hence, a manually designed procedure is often used
when training the models. In this paper, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs),
which is designed to perform multi-step inference implicitly through a
controller and shared memory. Without a human-designed inference procedure,
IRNs use training data to learn to perform multi-step inference in an embedding
neural space through the shared memory and controller. While the inference
procedure does not explicitly operate on top of observed triplets, our proposed
model outperforms all previous approaches on the popular FB15k benchmark by
more than 5.7%.
