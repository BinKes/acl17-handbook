Abstract#==#Many papers have been published on the knowledge base completion task in the
past few years. Most of these introduce novel architectures for relation
learning that are evaluated on standard datasets like FB15k and WN18. This
paper shows that the accuracy of almost all models published on the FB15k can
be outperformed by an appropriately tuned baseline --- our reimplementation of
the DistMult model. 
Our findings cast doubt on the claim that the performance improvements of
recent models are due to architectural changes as opposed to hyper-parameter
tuning or different training objectives.
This should prompt future research to re-consider how the performance of models
is evaluated and reported.
