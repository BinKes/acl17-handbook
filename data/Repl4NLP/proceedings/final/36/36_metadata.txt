Abstract#==#Vector representations and vector space modeling (VSM) play a central role in
modern machine learning. We propose a novel approach to ‘vector similarity
searching’ over dense semantic representations of words and documents that
can be deployed on top of traditional inverted-index-based fulltext engines,
taking advantage of their robustness, stability, scalability and ubiquity.

We show that this approach allows the indexing and querying of dense vectors in
text domains. This opens up exciting avenues for major efficiency gains, along
with simpler deployment, scaling and monitoring.

The end result is a fast and scalable vector database with a tunable trade-off
between vector search performance and quality, backed by a standard fulltext
engine such as Elasticsearch.

We empirically demonstrate its querying performance and quality by applying
this solution to the task of semantic searching over a dense vector
representation of the entire English Wikipedia.
