Abstract#==#Many domain adaptation approaches rely
on learning cross domain shared representations
to transfer the knowledge learned
in one domain to other domains. Traditional
domain adaptation only considers
adapting for one task. In this paper, we
explore multi-task representation learning
under the domain adaptation scenario. We
propose a neural network framework that
supports domain adaptation for multiple
tasks simultaneously, and learns shared
representations that better generalize for
domain adaptation. We apply the proposed
framework to domain adaptation
for sequence tagging problems considering
two tasks: Chinese word segmentation
and named entity recognition. Experiments
show that multi-task domain adaptation
works better than disjoint domain
adaptation for each task, and achieves the
state-of-the-art results for both tasks in the
social media domain.
