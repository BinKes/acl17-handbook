Abstract#==#Word embeddings, which represent a word as a point in a vector space, have
become ubiquitous to several NLP tasks.
A recent line of work uses bilingual (two languages) corpora to learn a
different vector
 for each sense of a word, by exploiting crosslingual signals to aid sense
identification.
We present a multi-view Bayesian non-parametric algorithm which improves
multi-sense wor
d embeddings by
(a) using multilingual (i.e., more than two languages) corpora to significantly
improve
sense embeddings beyond what one achieves with bilingual information, and (b)
uses a principled approach to learn a variable number of senses per word, in a
data-driven manner.
Ours is the first approach with the ability to leverage multilingual corpora
efficiently
 for multi-sense representation learning.
Experiments show that multilingual training significantly improves performance
over monolingual and bilingual training, by allowing us to combine different
parallel corpora to
leverage multilingual context. Multilingual training yields comparable
performance to a
state of the art monolingual model trained on five times more training data.
