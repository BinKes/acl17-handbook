Abstract#==#Tagging news articles or blog posts with relevant tags from a collection of
predefined ones is coined as document tagging in this work. Accurate tagging of
articles can benefit several downstream applications such as recommendation and
search. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple approach called DocTag2Vec
to accomplish this task. We substantially extend Word2Vec and Doc2Vec -- two
popular models for learning  distributed representation of words and documents.
In DocTag2Vec, we simultaneously learn the representation of words, documents,
and tags in a joint vector space during training, and employ the simple
k-nearest neighbor search to predict tags for unseen documents. In contrast to
previous multi-label learning methods, DocTag2Vec directly deals with raw text
instead of provided feature vector, and in addition, enjoys advantages like the
learning of tag representation, and the ability of handling newly created tags.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on
several datasets and show promising results against state-of-the-art methods.
