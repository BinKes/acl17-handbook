Abstract#==#A novel character-level neural language model is proposed in this paper. The
proposed model incorporates a biologically inspired temporal hierarchy in the
architecture for representing multiple compositions of language in order to
handle longer sequences for the character-level language model. The temporal
hierarchy is introduced in the language model by utilizing a Gated Recurrent
Neural Network with multiple timescales. The proposed model incorporates a
timescale adaptation mechanism for enhancing the performance of the language
model. We evaluate our proposed model using the popular Penn Treebank and Text8
corpora. The experiments show that the use of multiple timescales in a Neural
Language Model (NLM) enables improved performance despite having fewer
parameters and with no additional computation requirements. Our experiments
also demonstrate the ability of the adaptive temporal hierarchies to represent
multiple compositonality without the help of complex hierarchical architectures
and shows that better representation of the longer sequences lead to enhanced
performance of the probabilistic language model.
