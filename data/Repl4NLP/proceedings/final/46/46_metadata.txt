Abstract#==#We propose a simple log-bilinear softmax-based model to deal with vocabulary
expansion in machine translation. Our model uses word embeddings trained on
significantly large unlabelled monolingual
corpora and learns over a fairly small, word-to-word bilingual dictionary.
Given an out-of-vocabulary source word, the model generates a probabilistic
list of possible translations in the target language using the trained
bilingual embeddings. We integrate these translation options into a standard
phrase-based statistical machine translation system and obtain consistent
improvements in translation quality on the English--Spanish language pair. When
tested over an out-of-domain testset, we get a significant improvement of 3.9
BLEU points.
