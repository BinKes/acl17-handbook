Abstract#==#Learning word representations to capture the semantics and compositionality of
language has received much research interest in natural language processing.
Beyond the popular vector space models, matrix representations for words have
been proposed, since then, matrix multiplication can serve as natural
composition operation. In this work, we investigate the problem of learning
matrix representations of words. We present a learning approach for
compositional matrix-space models for the task of sentiment analysis. We show
that our approach, which learns the matrices gradually in two steps,
outperforms other approaches and a gradient-descent baseline in terms of
quality and computational cost.
