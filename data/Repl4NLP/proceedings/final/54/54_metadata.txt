Abstract#==#In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of densely connected layers into
recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our proposed architecture on the Penn
Treebank language modeling task. We show that we can obtain similar perplexity
scores with six times fewer parameters compared to a standard stacked 2-
layer LSTM model trained with dropout (Zaremba et al., 2014). In contrast with
the current usage of skip connections, we show that densely connecting only a
few
stacked layers with skip connections already yields significant perplexity
reductions.
