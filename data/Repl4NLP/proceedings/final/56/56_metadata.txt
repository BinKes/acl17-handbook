Abstract#==#Language in social media is a dynamic system, constantly evolving and adapting,
with words and concepts rapidly emerging, disappearing, and changing their
meaning. These changes can be estimated using word representations in context,
over time and across locations. A number of methods have been proposed to track
these spatiotemporal changes but no general method exists to evaluate the
quality of these representations. Previous work largely focused on qualitative
evaluation, which we improve by proposing a set of visualizations that
highlight changes in text representation over both space and time. We
demonstrate usefulness of novel spatiotemporal representations to explore and
characterize specific aspects of the corpus of tweets collected from European
countries over a two-week period centered around the terrorist attacks in
Brussels in March 2016. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate spatiotemporal
representations by feeding them into a downstream classification task -- event
type prediction. Thus, our work is the first to provide both intrinsic
(qualitative) and extrinsic (quantitative) evaluation of text representations
for spatiotemporal trends.
