Abstract#==#We investigate the pertinence of methods from algebraic topology for text data
analysis. These methods enable the development of mathematically-principled
isometric-invariant mappings from a set of vectors to a document embedding,
which is stable with respect to the geometry of the document in the selected
metric space. 
In this work, we evaluate the utility of these topology-based document
representations in traditional NLP tasks, specifically document clustering and
sentiment classification.
We find that the embeddings do not benefit text analysis. In fact, performance
is worse than simple techniques like tf-idf, indicating that the geometry of
the document does not provide enough variability for classification on the
basis of topic or sentiment in the chosen datasets.
