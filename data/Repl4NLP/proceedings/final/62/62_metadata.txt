Abstract#==#Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gathered a lot of attention from
the computer vision community, yielding impressive results for image
generation. Advances in the adversarial generation of natural language from
noise however are not commensurate with the progress made in generating images,
and still lag far behind likelihood based methods. In this paper, we take a
step towards generating natural language  with a GAN objective alone. We
introduce a simple baseline that addresses the discrete output space problem
without relying on gradient estimators and show that it is able to achieve
state-of-the-art results on a Chinese poem generation dataset. We present
quantitative results on generating sentences from context-free and
probabilistic context-free grammars, and qualitative language modeling results.
A conditional version is also described that can generate sequences conditioned
on sentence characteristics.
