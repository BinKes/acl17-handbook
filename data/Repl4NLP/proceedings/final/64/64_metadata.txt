Abstract#==#Deep neural networks 
have advanced the state of the art 
in named entity recognition. 
However, under typical training procedures,
advantages over classical methods
emerge only with large datasets. 
As a result,  deep learning is employed
only when large public datasets or a large budget 
for manually labeling data is available. 
In this work, we show otherwise: 
by combining deep learning with active learning,
we can outperform classical methods 
even with a significantly smaller amount of training data.
