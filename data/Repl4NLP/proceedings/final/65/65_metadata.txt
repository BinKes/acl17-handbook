Abstract#==#This paper discusses a potential problem with tree-sequence models that induce
syntax, in that there exists a failure mode when naively treating the
relationship between composition and parsing. The first section presents a
tree-sequence model that induces syntax. The second section proposes a strategy
that attempts to prevent coadaptation between composition and parsing. The
third section covers a method for randomly sampling binary trees in a
transition-based setting, a simple and useful technique for transition-based
parsing models.
