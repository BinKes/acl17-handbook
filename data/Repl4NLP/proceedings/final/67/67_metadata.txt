Abstract#==#Many recent advances in deep learning for natural language processing have come
at increasing computational cost, but the power of these state-of-the-art
models is not needed for every example in a dataset. We demonstrate two
approaches to reducing unnecessary computation in cases where a fast but weak
baseline classier and a stronger, slower model are both available. Applying an
AUC-based metric to the task of sentiment classification, we find significant
efficiency gains with both a probability-threshold method for reducing
computational cost and one that uses a secondary decision network.
