Abstract#==#Robot-directed communication is variable, and may change based on human
perception of robot capabilities. To collect training data for a dialogue
system and to investigate possible communication changes over time, we
developed a Wizard-of-Oz study that (a) simulates a robot's limited
understanding, and (b) collects dialogues where human participants build a
progressively better mental model of the robot's understanding. With ten
participants, we collected ten hours of human-robot dialogue. We analyzed the
structure of instructions that participants gave to a remote robot before it
responded. Our findings show a general initial preference for including metric
information (e.g., move forward 3 feet) over landmarks (e.g., move to the desk)
in motion commands, but this decreased over time, suggesting changes in
perception.
