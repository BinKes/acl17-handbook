Abstract#==#Robots operating alongside humans in diverse, stochastic environments must be
able to accurately interpret natural language commands. These instructions
often fall into one of two categories: those that specify a goal condition or
target state, and those that specify explicit actions, or how to perform a
given task. Recent approaches have used reward functions as a semantic
representation of goal-based commands, which allows for the use of a
state-of-the-art planner to find a policy for the given task. However, these
reward functions cannot be directly used to represent action-oriented commands.
We introduce a new hybrid approach, the Deep Recurrent Action-Goal Grounding
Network (DRAGGN), for task grounding and execution that handles natural
language from either category as input, and generalizes to unseen environments.
Our robot-simulation results demonstrate that a system successfully
interpreting both goal-oriented and action-oriented task specifications brings
us closer to robust natural language understanding for human-robot interaction.
