Abstract#==#This paper describes how language is
grounded by a comprehension system
called Lucia within a robotic agent called
Rosie that can manipulate objects and
navigate indoors. The whole system is
built within the Soar cognitive architecture
and uses Embodied Construction Grammar
(ECG) as a formalism for describing
linguistic knowledge. Grounding is performed
using knowledge from the grammar
itself, from the linguistic context,
from the agents perception, and from an
ontology of long-term knowledge about
object categories and properties and actions
the agent can perform. The paper
also describes a benchmark corpus of 200
sentences in this domain along with test
versions of the world model and ontology
and gold-standard meanings for each
of the sentences. The benchmark is contained
in the supplemental materials.
