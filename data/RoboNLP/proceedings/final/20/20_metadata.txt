Abstract#==#Distributional word representation methods exploit word co-occurrences to build
compact vector encodings of words. While these representations enjoy widespread
use in modern natural language processing, it is unclear whether they
accurately encode all necessary facets of conceptual meaning. In this paper, we
evaluate how well these representations can predict perceptual and conceptual
features of concrete concepts, drawing on two semantic norm datasets sourced
from human participants. We find that several standard word representations
fail to encode many salient perceptual features of concepts, and show that
these deficits correlate with word-word similarity prediction errors. Our
analyses provide motivation for grounded and embodied language learning
approaches, which may help to remedy these deficits.
