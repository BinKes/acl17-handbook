Abstract#==#Recognition of social signals, coming from human facial expressions or prosody
of human speech, is a popular research topic in human-robot interaction
studies. There is also a long line of research in the spoken dialogue community
that investigates user satisfaction in relation to dialogue characteristics.
However, very little research relates a combination of multimodal social
signals and language features detected during spoken face-to-face human-robot
interaction to the resulting user perception of a robot. In this paper we show
how different emotional facial expressions of human users, in combination with
prosodic characteristics of human speech and features of human-robot dialogue,
correlate with users’ impressions of the robot after a conversation. We find
that happiness in the user’s recognised facial expression strongly correlates
with likeability of a robot, while dialogue-related features (such as number of
human turns or number of sentences per robot utterance) correlate with
perceiving a robot as intelligent. In addition, we show that the facial
expression emotional features and prosody are better predictors of
human ratings related to perceived robot likeability and anthropomorphism,
while linguistic and non-linguistic features more often predict perceived robot
intelligence and interpretability. As such, these characteristics may in future
be used as an online reward signal for in-situ Reinforcement Learning-based
adaptive human-robot dialogue systems.
