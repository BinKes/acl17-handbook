Abstract#==#Agents that communicate back and forth with humans to help them execute
non-linguistic tasks are a long sought goal of AI. These agents need to
translate between utterances and actionable meaning representations that can be
interpreted by task-specific problem solvers in a context-dependent manner.
They should also be able to learn such actionable interpretations for new
predicates on the fly. We define an agent architecture for this scenario and
present a series of experiments in the Blocks World domain that illustrate how
our architecture supports language learning and problem solving in this domain.
