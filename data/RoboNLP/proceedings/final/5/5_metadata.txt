Abstract#==#Service robots are expected to operate in specific environments, where the
presence of humans plays a key role. A major feature of such robotics platforms
is thus the ability to react to spoken commands. This requires the
understanding of the user utterance with an accuracy able to trigger the robot
reaction.
Such correct interpretation of linguistic exchanges depends on physical,
cognitive and language-dependent aspects related to the environment. In this
work, we present the empirical evaluation of an adaptive Spoken Language
Understanding chain for robotic commands, that explicitly depends on the
operational environment during both the learning and recognition stages. The
effectiveness of such a context-sensitive command interpretation is tested
against an extension of an already existing corpus of commands, that introduced
explicit perceptual knowledge: this enabled deeper measures proving that more
accurate disambiguation capabilities can be actually obtained.
