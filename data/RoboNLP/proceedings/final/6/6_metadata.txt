Abstract#==#We present a cognitively plausible system capable of acquiring knowledge in
language and vision from pairs of short video clips and linguistic
descriptions. The aim of this work is to teach a robot manipulator how to
execute natural language commands by demonstration. This is achieved by first
learning a set of visual `concepts' that abstract the visual feature spaces
into concepts that have human-level meaning. Second, learning the
mapping/grounding between words and the extracted visual concepts. Third,
inducing grammar rules via a semantic representation known as Robot Control
Language (RCL).
We evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised
grounding and grammar induction systems, and show that a robot can learn to
execute never seen-before commands from pairs of unlabelled linguistic and
visual inputs.
