Abstract#==#Psychiatry is an area of medicine that strongly bases its diagnoses on the
psychiatrist’s subjective appreciation. More precisely, speech is used almost
exclusively as a window to the patient’s mind. Few other cues are available
to objectively justify a diagnostic, unlike what happens in other disciplines
which count on laboratory tests or imaging procedures, such as X-rays. Daily
practice is based on the use of semi-structured interviews and standardized
tests to build the diagnoses, heavily relying on her personal experience. This
methodology has a big problem: diagnoses are commonly validated a posteriori in
function of how the pharmacological treatment works. This validation cannot be
done until months after the start of the treatment and, if the patient
condition does not improve, the psychiatrist often changes the diagnosis and
along with the pharmacological treatment. This delay prolongs the patient's
suffering until the correct diagnosis is found. According to NIMH, more than 1%
and 2% of US population is affected by Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder,
respectively. Moreover, the WHO reported that the global cost of mental illness
reached $2.5T in 2010 [1] .

The task of diagnosis, largely simplified, mainly consists of understanding the
mind state through the extraction of patterns from the patient's speech and
finding the best matching pathology in the standard diagnostic literature. This
pipeline, consisting of extracting patterns and then classifying them, loosely
resembles the common pipelines used in supervised learning schema. Therefore,
we propose to augment the psychiatrists’ diagnosis toolbox with an artificial
intelligence system based on natural language processing and machine learning
algorithms. The proposed system would assist in the diagnostic using a
patient’s speech as input. The understanding and insights obtained from
customizing these systems to specific pathologies is likely to be more broadly
applicable to other NLP tasks, therefore we expect to make contributions not
only for psychiatry but also within the computer science community. We intend
to develop these ideas and evaluate them beyond the lab setting. Our end goal
is to make it possible for a practitioner to integrate our tools into her daily
practice with minimal effort
