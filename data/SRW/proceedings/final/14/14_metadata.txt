Abstract#==#Students choose to use flashcard applications available on the Internet to help
memorize word-meaning pairs. This is helpful for tests such as GRE, TOEFL or
IELTS, which emphasize on verbal skills. However, monotonous nature of
flashcard applications can be diminished with the help of Cognitive Science
through Testing Effect. Experimental evidences have shown that memory tests are
an important tool for long term retention (Roediger and Karpicke, 2006). Based
on these evidences, we developed a novel flashcard application called "V for
Vocab" that implements short answer based tests for learning new words.
Furthermore, we aid this by implementing our short answer grading algorithm
which automatically scores the user's answer. The algorithm makes use of an
alternate thesaurus instead of traditional Wordnet and delivers
state-of-the-art performance on popular word similarity datasets. We also look
to lay the foundation for analysis based on implicit data collected from our
application.
