Abstract#==#We propose a novel sentential paraphrase acquisition method.
To build a well-balanced corpus for Paraphrase Identification, we especially
focus on acquiring both non-trivial positive and negative instances.
We use multiple machine translation systems to generate positive candidates and
a monolingual corpus to extract negative candidates.
To collect non-trivial instances, the candidates are uniformly sampled by word
overlap rate.
Finally, annotators judge whether the candidates are either positive or
negative.
Using this method, we built and released the first evaluation corpus for
Japanese paraphrase identification, which comprises 655 sentence pairs.
