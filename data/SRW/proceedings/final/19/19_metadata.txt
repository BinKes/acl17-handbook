Abstract#==#In this paper we propose to solve the problem of Visual Question answering by
using a novel segmentation guided attention based networks which we call
SegAttendNet. 
We use image segmentation maps, generated by a Fully Convolutional Deep Neural
Network to refine our attention maps and use these refined attention maps to
make the model focus on the relevant parts of the image to answer a question.
The refined attention maps are used by the LSTM network to learn to produce the
answer.
 We presently train our model on the visual7W dataset and do a category wise
evaluation of the 7 question categories. We achieve state of the art results on
this dataset and beat the previous benchmark on this dataset by a 1.5% margin
improving the question answering accuracy from 54.1% to 55.6% and demonstrate
improvements in each of the question categories. We also visualize our
generated attention maps and note their improvement over the attention maps
generated by the previous best approach.
