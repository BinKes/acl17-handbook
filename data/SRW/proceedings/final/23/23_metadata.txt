Abstract#==#Network representation is the basis of many applications and of extensive
interest in various fields, such as information retrieval, social network
analysis, and recommendation systems. Most previous methods for network
representation only consider the incomplete aspects of a problem, including
link structure, node information, and partial integration. The present study
introduces a deep network representation model that seamlessly integrates the
text information and structure of a network. The model captures highly
non-linear relationships between nodes and complex features of a network by
exploiting the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is a deep unsupervised
generation algorithm. The representation learned with a paragraph vector model
is merged with that learned with the VAE to obtain the network representation,
which preserves both structure and text information. Comprehensive experiments
is conducted on benchmark datasets and find that the introduced model performs
better than state-of-the-art techniques.
