Abstract#==#Phonemic segmentation of speech is a critical step of speech recognition
systems. We propose a novel unsupervised algorithm based on sequence prediction
models such as Markov chains and recurrent neural networks. Our approach
consists in analyzing the error profile of a model trained to predict speech
features frame-by-frame.Specifically, we try to learn the dynamics of speech in
the MFCC space and hypothesize boundaries from local maxima in the prediction
error. We evaluate our system on the TIMIT dataset, with improvements over
similar methods
