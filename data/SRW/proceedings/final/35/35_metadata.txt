Abstract#==#When it comes to computational language processing systems, humour is a
relatively unexplored domain, especially more so for Hindi (or rather, most
languages other than English). Most researchers agree that a joke consists of
two main parts - the setup and the punchline, which the humour being encoded in
the incongruity between the two. In this paper, we look at Dur se Dekha jokes,
a restricted domain of humorous three liner poetry in Hindi. We analyze their
structure to understand how humour is encoded in them and formalize it. We then
develop a system which is successfully able to generate a basic form of these
jokes.
