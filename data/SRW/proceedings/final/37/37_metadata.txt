Abstract#==#Manually grading the Response to Text Assessment (RTA) is labor intensive.
Therefore, an automatic method is being developed for scoring analytical
writing when the RTA is administered in large numbers of classrooms. Our
long-term goal is to also use this scoring method to provide formative feedback
to students and teachers about students' writing quality.  As a first step
towards this goal, interpretable features for automatically scoring the
evidence rubric of the RTA have been developed. In this paper, we present a
simple but promising method for improving evidence scoring by employing the
word embedding model. We evaluate our method on corpora of responses written by
upper elementary students.
