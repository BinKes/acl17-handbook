Abstract#==#This paper describes the SoccEval Annotation Project, an annotation schema
designed to support machine-learning classification efforts to evaluate the
performance of soccer players based on match reports taken from online news
sources. In addition to factual information about player attributes and
actions, the schema annotates subjective opinions about them. After explaining
the annotation schema and annotation process, we describe a machine learning
experiment. Classifiers trained on features derived from annotated data
performed better than a baseline trained on unigram features. Initial results
suggest that improvements can be made to the annotation scheme and guidelines
as well as the amount of data annotated. We believe our schema could be
potentially expanded to extract more information about soccer players and
teams.
