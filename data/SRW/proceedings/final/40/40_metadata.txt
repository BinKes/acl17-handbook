Abstract#==#Automated speech recognition (ASR) plays a significant role in training and
simulation systems for air traffic controllers. However, because English is the
default language used in air traffic control (ATC), ASR systems often encounter
difficulty with speakers' non-native accents, for which there is a paucity of
data. This paper examines the effects of accent adaptation on the recognition
of non-native English speech in the ATC domain. Accent adaptation has been
demonstrated to be an effective way to model under-resourced speech, and can be
applied to a variety of models. We use Subspace Gaussian Mixture Models (SGMMs)
with the Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit to adapt acoustic models from
American English to German-accented English, and compare it against other
adaptation methods. Our results provide additional evidence that SGMMs can be
an efficient and effective way to approach this problem, particularly with
smaller amounts of accented training data.
