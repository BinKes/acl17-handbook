Abstract#==#Motivated by concerns for user privacy, we design a steganographic system
("stegosystem") that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages without
an adversary detecting that such an exchange is taking place. In this paper, we
propose a novel linguistic stegosystem based on a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network. We demonstrate our approach on the Twitter and Enron email
datasets and show that it yields high-quality steganographic text while
significantly improving capacity (encrypted bits per word) relative to the
state-of-the-art.
