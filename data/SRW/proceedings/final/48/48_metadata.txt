Abstract#==#One of the challenges semantic parsers face involves upstream errors
originating from pre-processing modules such as ASR and syntactic parsers,
which undermine the end result from the get go.
We report the work in progress on a novel incremental semantic parsing
algorithm that supports simultaneous application of independent heuristics and
facilitates the construction of partial but potentially actionable meaning
representations to overcome this problem.
Our contribution to this point is mainly theoretical. In future work we intend
to evaluate the algorithm as part of a dialogue understanding system on state
of the art benchmarks.
