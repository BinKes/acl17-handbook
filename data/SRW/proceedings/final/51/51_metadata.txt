Abstract#==#Social media accumulates vast amounts of online conversations that enable
data-driven
modeling of chat dialogues. It is, however, still hard to utilize the neural
network-based SEQ2SEQ model for dialogue modeling in spite of its acknowledged
success in machine translation. The main challenge comes from the high degrees
of freedom of responses in dialogues. In this study, we explore neural
conversational models that have general mechanisms for handling a variety of
situations
that affect our response. In our experiments, we confirmed the effectiveness
of the proposed method in a response selection test by using massive dialogue
data
we have collected from Twitter.
