Abstract#==#Accurately representing the meaning of a piece of text, otherwise known as
sentence modelling, is an important component in many natural language
inference tasks. We survey the spectrum of these methods, which lie along two
dimensions: input representation granularity and composition model complexity.
Using this framework, we reveal in our quantitative and qualitative experiments
the limitations of the current state-of-the-art model in the context of
sentence similarity tasks.
