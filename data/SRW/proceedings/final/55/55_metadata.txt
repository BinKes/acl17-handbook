Abstract#==#Research into emoji in textual communication has, thus far, focused on
high-frequency usages and the ambiguity of interpretations. Investigation of
emoji uses across a wide range of uses can divide them into different
linguistic functions: function and content words, or multimodal affective
markers. Identifying where an emoji is merely replacing part of the text allows
NLP tools the possibility of parsing them as any other word or phrase. Smiling
emoticons are usually left out of data sets, but if they are used as the noun
”smile” or the verb ”smiling”, we should be able to predict their part
of speech. We report on an annotation task on English Twitter data with the
goal of classifying emoji usage by these categories, and on the effectiveness
of a classifier trained on these annotations. We find that it is possible to
train a classifier to tell the difference between those emoji used as
linguistic content words and those used as paralinguistic or affective
multimodal markers even with a small amount of training data, but that accurate
sub-classification of these multimodal emoji into specific classes like
attitude, topic, or gesture will require more data and more feature
engineering.
