Abstract#==#Doctor-patient conversation is considered a contributing factor to antibiotic
over-prescription.
Some language practices have been identified as parent pressuring doctors for
prescribing; 
other practices are considered as likely to engender parent resistance to
non-antibiotic treatment recommendations. In social science studies, approaches
such as conversation analysis have been applied to identify those language
practices. Current research for dialogue systems offer an alternative approach.
Past research proved that corpus-based approaches have been effectively used
for research involving modeling dialogue acts and sequential relations. In this
proposal, we propose a corpus-based study of doctor-patient conversations of
antibiotic treatment negotiation in pediatric consultations. Based on findings
from conversation analysis studies, we use a computational linguistic approach
to assist annotating and modeling of doctor-patient language practices, and
analyzing their influence on antibiotic over-prescribing.
