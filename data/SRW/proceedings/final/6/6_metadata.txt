Abstract#==#Unsupervised representation learning for tweets is an important research field
which helps in solving several business applications such as sentiment
analysis, hashtag prediction, paraphrase detection and microblog ranking. A
good tweet representation learning model must handle the idiosyncratic nature
of tweets which poses several challenges such as short length, informal words,
unusual grammar and misspellings. However, there is a lack of prior work which
surveys the representation learning models with a focus on tweets. In this
work, we organize the models based on its objective function which aids the
understanding of the literature. We also provide interesting future directions,
which we believe are fruitful in advancing this field by building high-quality
tweet representation learning models.
