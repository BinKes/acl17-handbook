Abstract#==#We propose a novel model which can be used to align the sentences of two
different languages using neural architectures. First, we train our model to
get the bilingual word embeddings and then, we create a similarity matrix
between the words of the two sentences. Because of different lengths of the
sentences involved, we get a matrix of varying dimension. We dynamically pool
the similarity matrix into a matrix of fixed dimension and use Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to classify the sentences as aligned or not. To further
improve upon this technique, we bucket the sentence pairs to be classified into
different groups and train CNN's separately. Our approach not only solves
sentence alignment problem but our model can be regarded as a generic
bag-of-words similarity measure for monolingual or bilingual corpora.
