Abstract#==#The paper describes the participation of the team ``TwiSE'' in the SemEval-2017
challenge.
Specifically, I participated at Task 4 entitled ``Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter'' for which I implemented systems for five-point tweet classification
(Subtask C) and five-point tweet quantification (Subtask E) for English tweets.
In the feature extraction steps the systems rely on the vector space model,
morpho-syntactic analysis of the tweets and several sentiment lexicons. 
The classification step of Subtask C uses a Logistic Regression trained with
the one-versus-rest approach. Another instance of Logistic Regression combined
with the classify-and-count approach is trained for the quantification task of
Subtask E.  
In the official leaderboard the system is ranked \textit{5/15} in Subtask C and
\textit{2/12} in Subtask E.
