Abstract#==#The RUFINO team proposed a non-supervised, conceptually-simple and
low-cost approach for addressing the Multilingual and Cross-lingual
Semantic Word Similarity challenge at SemEval 2017. The proposed systems
were cross-lingual extensions of popular monolingual lexical similarity
approaches such as PMI and word2vec. The extensions were possible
by means of a small parallel list of concepts similar to the Swadesh's
list, which we obtained in a semi-automatic way. In spite of its simplicity,
our approach showed to be effective obtaining statistically-significant
and consistent results in all datasets proposed for the task. Besides,
we provide some research directions for improving this novel and affordable
approach.
