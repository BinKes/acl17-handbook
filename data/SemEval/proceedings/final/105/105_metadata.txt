Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed at LIA for the SemEval-2017
evaluation campaign. The goal of Task 4.A was to identify sentiment polarity in
tweets. The system is an ensemble of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network Long Short-Term
Memory (RNN-LSTM). We initialize the input representation of DNN with different
sets of embeddings trained on large datasets. The ensemble of DNNs are combined
using a score-level fusion approach. The system ranked 2nd at SemEval-2017 and
obtained an average recall of 67.6%.
