Abstract#==#In this paper we propose a system for reranking
answers for a given question. Our
method builds on a siamese CNN architecture
which is extended by two attention
mechanisms. The approach was evaluated
on the datasets of the SemEval-2017 competition
for Community Question Answering
(cQA), where it achieved 7th place obtaining
a MAP score of 86:24 points on the
Question-Comment Similarity subtask.
