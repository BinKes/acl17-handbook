Abstract#==#This paper describes our unsupervised knowledge-free approach to the
SemEval-2017 Task 1 Competition. The proposed method makes use of Paragraph
Vector for assessing the semantic similarity between pairs of sentences. We
experimented with various dimensions of the vector and three state-of-the-art
similarity metrics. Given a cross-lingual task, we trained models corresponding
to its two languages and combined the models by averaging the similarity
scores. The results of our submitted runs are above the median scores for five
out of seven test sets by means of Pearson Correlation. Moreover, one of our
system runs performed best on the Spanish-English-WMT test set ranking first
out of 53 runs submitted in total by all participants.
