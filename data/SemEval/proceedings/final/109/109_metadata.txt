Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2017 Task 10.
We competed in Subtask 1 and 2 which consist respectively in identifying all
the key phrases in scientific publications and label them with one of the three
categories: Task, Process, and Material.
These scientific publications are selected from Computer Science, Material
Sciences, and Physics domains. 
We followed a supervised approach for both subtasks by using a sequential
classifier (CRF - Conditional Random Fields).
For generating our solution we used a web-based application implemented in the
EU-funded research project, named CODE.
Our system achieved an F1 score of 0.39 for the Subtask 1 and 0.28 for the
Subtask 2.
