Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed for the task of temporal information
extraction from clinical narratives in the context of the 2017 Clinical
TempEval challenge. Clinical TempEval 2017 addressed the problem of temporal
reasoning in the clinical domain by providing annotated clinical notes,
pathology and radiology reports in line with Clinical TempEval challenges
2015/16, across two different evaluation phases focusing on cross domain
adaptation. Our team focused on subtasks involving extractions of temporal
spans and relations for which the developed systems showed average F-score of
0.45 and 0.47 across the two phases of evaluations.
