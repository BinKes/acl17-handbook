Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our system created for SemEval-2017 Task 7: Detection
and Interpretation of English Puns. We tackle subtask 1, pun detection, by
leveraging features selected from sentences to design a classifier that can
disambiguate between the presence or absence of a pun. We address subtask 2,
pun location, by utilizing a decision flow structure that uses presence or
absence of certain features to decide the next action. The results obtained by
our system are encouraging, considering the simplicity of the system. We
consider this system as a precursor for deeper exploration on efficient feature
selection for pun detection.
