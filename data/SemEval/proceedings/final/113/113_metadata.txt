Abstract#==#This paper describes our system, entitled
Idiom Savant, for the 7th Task of the Se-
meval 2017 workshop, “Detection and in-
terpretation of English Puns”. Our sys-
tem consists of two probabilistic models
for each type of puns using Google n-
gram and Word2Vec. Our system achieved
f-score of calculating, 0.663, and 0.07
in homographic puns and 0.8439, 0.6631,
and 0.0806 in heterographic puns in task
1, task 2, and task 3 respectively.
