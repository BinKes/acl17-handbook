Abstract#==#In this paper we report on the participation of the MERALI system to the
SemEval Task 2 Subtask 1. The MERALI system approaches conceptual similarity
through a simple, cognitively inspired, heuristics; it builds on a linguistic
resource, the TTCS-e, that relies on BabelNet, NASARI and ConceptNet. The
linguistic resource in fact contains a novel mixture of common-sense and
encyclopedic knowledge. The obtained results point out that there is ample room
for improvement, so that they are used to elaborate on present limitations and
on future steps.
