Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the opinion expressed in text.
Recently it has been used to study behavioral finance, and in particular the
effect of opinions and emotions on economic or financial decisions.
SemEval-2017 task 5 focuses on the financial market as the do- main for
sentiment analysis of text; specifically, task 5, subtask 1 focuses on
financial tweets about stock symbols. In this paper, we describe a machine
learning classifier for binary classification of financial tweets. We used
natural language processing techniques and the random forest algorithm to train
our model, and tuned it for the training dataset of Task 5, subtask 1. Our
system achieves the 7th rank on the leaderboard of the task.
