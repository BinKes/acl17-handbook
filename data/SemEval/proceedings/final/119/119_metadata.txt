Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach for SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter. We have participated in Subtask A: Message Polarity Classification
subtask and  developed two systems. The first system  uses  word embeddings for
feature representation and Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Naive
Bayes algorithms for classification of Twitter messages into negative, neutral
and positive polarity. The second system is based on Long Short Term Memory
Recurrent Neural Networks and uses word indexes as sequence of inputs for
feature representation.
