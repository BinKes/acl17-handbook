Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our system implementation for sentiment analysis in
Twitter. This system combines two models based on deep neural networks, namely
a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM)
recurrent neural network, through interpolation. Distributed representation of
words as vectors are input to the system, and the output is a sentiment class.
The neural network models are trained exclusively with the data sets provided
by the organizers of SemEval-2017 Task 4 Subtask A. Overall, this system has
achieved 0.618 for the average recall rate, 0.587 for the average F1 score, and
0.618 for accuracy.
