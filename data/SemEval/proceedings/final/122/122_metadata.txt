Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for humor ranking in tweets within the SemEval
2017 Task 6: \#HashtagWars (6A and 6B). For both subtasks, we use an
off-the-shelf gradient boosting model built on a rich set of features,
handcrafted to provide the model with the external knowledge needed to better
predict the humor in the text. The features capture various cultural references
and specific humor patterns. Our system ranked 2nd (officially 7th) among 10
submissions on the Subtask A and 2nd among 9 submissions on the Subtask B.
