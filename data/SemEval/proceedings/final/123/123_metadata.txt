Abstract#==#This paper describes Luminoso's participation in SemEval 2017 Task 2,
``Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity'', with a system
based on ConceptNet. ConceptNet is an open, multilingual knowledge graph that
focuses on general knowledge that relates the meanings of words and phrases.
Our submission to SemEval was an update of previous work that builds
high-quality, multilingual word embeddings from a combination of ConceptNet and
distributional semantics. Our system took first place in both subtasks. It
ranked first in 4 out of 5 of the separate languages, and also ranked first in
all 10 of the cross-lingual language pairs.
