Abstract#==#This paper presents our relation extraction system for subtask C of
SemEval-2017 Task 10: ScienceIE. Assuming that the keyphrases are already
annotated in the input data, our work explores a  wide range of linguistic
features, applies various feature selection techniques, optimizes the hyper
parameters and class weights and experiments with different problem
formulations (single classification model vs individual classifiers for each
keyphrase type, single-step classifier vs pipeline classifier for hyponym
relations). Performance of five popular classification algorithms are evaluated
for each problem formulation along with feature selection. The best setting
achieved an F1 score of 71.0% for synonym and 30.0% for hyponym relation on the
test data.
