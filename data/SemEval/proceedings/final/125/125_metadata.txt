Abstract#==#This paper describes the HHU system that participated in Task 2 of SemEval
2017, Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word Similarity. We introduce our
unsupervised embedding learning technique and describe how it was employed and
configured to address the problems of monolingual and multilingual word
similarity measurement. This paper reports from empirical evaluations on the
benchmark provided by the task's organizers.
