Abstract#==#This paper reports the STS-UHH participation in the SemEval 2017 shared
Task 1 of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). Overall, we submitted 3 runs
covering
monolingual and cross-lingual STS tracks. Our participation involves two
approaches:
unsupervised approach, which estimates a word alignment-based similarity
score, and supervised approach, which combines dependency graph similarity
and coverage features with lexical similarity measures using regression
methods. We also present a way on ensembling both models. Out of 84 submitted
runs, our team best multi-lingual run has been ranked 12th in overall
performance
with correlation of 0.61, 7th among 31 participating teams.
