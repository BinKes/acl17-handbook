Abstract#==#Clinical TempEval 2017 (SemEval 2017 Task 12) addresses the task of
cross-domain temporal extraction from clinical text. We present a system for
this task that uses supervised learning for the extraction of temporal
expression and event spans with corresponding attributes and narrative
container relations. Approaches include conditional random fields and decision
tree ensembles, using lexical, syntactic, semantic, distributional, and
rule-based features. Our system received best or second best scores in TIMEX3
span, EVENT span, and CONTAINS relation extraction.
