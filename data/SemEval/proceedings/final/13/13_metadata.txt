Abstract#==#Recently, neural twitter sentiment classification has become one of
state-of-thearts, which relies less feature engineering work compared with
traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective ensemble
method to further boost the performances of neural models. We collect several
word embedding sets which are publicly released (often are learned on different
corpus) or constructed by running Skip-gram on released large-scale corpus. We
make an assumption that different word embeddings cover different words and
encode different semantic knowledge, thus using them together can improve the
generalizations and performances of neural models. In the SemEval 2017, our
method ranks 1st in Accuracy, 5th in AverageR. Meanwhile, the additional
comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our model over these ones based
on only one word embedding set. We release our code for the method
duplicability.
