Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for fine-grained sentiment scoring of news
headlines submitted to SemEval 2017 task 5--subtask 2. Our system uses a
feature-light method that consists of a Support Vector Regression (SVR) with
various kernels and word vectors as features. Our best-performing submission
scored 3rd on the task out of 29 teams and 4th out of 45 submissions with a
cosine score of 0.733.
