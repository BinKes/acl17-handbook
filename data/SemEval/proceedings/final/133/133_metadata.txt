Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our participation at the subtask of extraction of
relationships between two identified keyphrases. This task can be very helpful
in improving search engines for scientific articles. Our approach is based on
the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the training
dataset. This deep learning model has already achieved successful
results for the extraction relationships between named entities. Thus, our
hypothesis is that this model can be also applied to extract relations between
keyphrases. The official results of the task show that
our architecture obtained an F1-score of 0.38% for Keyphrases Relation
Classification. This performance is lower than the expected due to the generic
preprocessing phase and the basic configuration of the
CNN model, more complex architectures are proposed as future work to increase
the classification rate.
