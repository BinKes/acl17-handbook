Abstract#==#This paper describes two systems that were used by the NileTMRG for addressing
Arabic Sentiment Analysis as part of SemEval-2017, task 4. NileTMRG
participated in three Arabic related subtasks which are: Subtask A (Message
Polarity Classification), Subtask B (Topic-Based Message Polarity
classification) and Subtask D  (Tweet quantification). For subtask A, we
made use of NUâ€™s sentiment analyzer which we augmented with a scored lexicon.
For subtasks B and D, we used an ensemble of  three different classifiers. The
first classifier was a convolutional neural network that used trained
(word2vec) word embeddings. The second classifier consisted of a  MultiLayer
Perceptron  while the third classifier was a Logistic regression model that
takes the same input as the second classifier. Voting between the three
classifiers was used to determine the final outcome.  In all three Arabic
related tasks in which NileTMRG participated, the team ranked at number one.
