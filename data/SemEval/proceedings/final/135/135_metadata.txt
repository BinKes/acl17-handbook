Abstract#==#We describe a modified shared-LSTM network for the Semantic Textual Similarity
(STS) task at SemEval-2017. The network builds on previously explored Siamese
network architectures. We treat max sentence length as an additional
hyperparameter to be tuned (beyond learning rate, regularization, and dropout).
Our results demonstrate that hand-tuning max sentence training length
significantly improves final accuracy. After optimizing hyperparameters, we
train the network on the multilingual semantic similarity task using
pre-translated sentences. We achieved a correlation of 0.4792 for all the
subtasks.  We achieved the fourth highest team correlation for Task 4b, which
was our best relative placement.
