Abstract#==#We describe an end-to-end pipeline processing approach for SemEval
2017's Task 10 to extract keyphrases and their relations from
scientific publications.  We jointly identify and classify keyphrases
by modeling the subtasks as sequential labeling.  Our system utilizes
standard, surface-level features along with the adjacent word
features, and performs conditional decoding on whole text to extract
keyphrases.  

We focus only on the identification and typing of keyphrases (Subtasks
A and B, together referred as extraction), but provide an end-to-end system
inclusive of keyphrase
relation identification (Subtask C) for completeness.  Our top
performing configuration achieves an $F_1$ of 0.27 for the end-to-end
keyphrase extraction and relation identification scenario on the final test
data, and
compares on par to other top ranked systems for keyphrase extraction.  Our
system outperforms other techniques that do not employ global decoding
and hence do not account for dependencies between keyphrases. We
believe this is crucial for keyphrase classification in the given
context of scientific document mining.
