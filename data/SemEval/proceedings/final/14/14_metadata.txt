Abstract#==#This paper presents a system that participated in SemEval 2017 Task 10 (subtask
A and subtask B): Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific
Publications (Augenstein et al., 2017). Our proposed approach utilizes external
knowledge to enrich feature representation of candidate keyphrase, including
Wikipedia, IEEE taxonomy and pre-trained word embeddings etc. Ensemble of 
unsupervised models, random forest and linear models are used for candidate
keyphrase ranking and keyphrase type classification. Our system achieves the
3rd place in subtask A and 4th place in subtask B.
