Abstract#==#For the competition SemEval-2017 we investigated the possibility of performing
stance classification (support, deny, query or comment) for messages in Twitter
conversation threads related to rumours. Stance classification is interesting
since it can provide a basis for rumour veracity assessment. Our ensemble
classification approach of combining convolutional neural networks with both
automatic rule mining and manually written rules achieved a final accuracy of
74.9% on the competition’s test data set for Task 8A. To improve
classification we also experimented with data relabeling and using the
grammatical structure of the tweet contents for classification.
