Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our systems for the “SemEval-2017 Task-5 on Fine-
Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News”. In our system,
we combined hand-engineered lexical, sentiment and metadata features, the
representations learned from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) with Attention model applied on
top. With this architecture we obtained weighted cosine similarity scores of
0.72 and 0.74 for subtask-1 and subtask-2, respectively. Using the official
scoring system, our system ranked the second place for subtask-2 and eighth
place for the subtask-1. It ranked first for both of the subtasks by the scores
achieved by an alternate scoring system.
