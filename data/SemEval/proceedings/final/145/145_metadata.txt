Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission to SemEval-2017 Task 3 Subtask D, "Question
Answer Ranking in Arabic Community Question Answering". In this work, we
applied a supervised machine learning approach to automatically re-rank a set
of QA pairs according to their relevance to a given question. We employ
features based on latent semantic models, namely WTMF, as well as a set of
lexical features based on string lengths and surface level matching. The
proposed system ranked first out of 3 submissions, with a MAP score of 61.16\%.
