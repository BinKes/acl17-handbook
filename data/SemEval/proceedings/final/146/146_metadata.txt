Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2017 Task 3 on Community 
Question  Answering (cQA). The Question Similarity subtask (B) aims to rank  a
set of related questions retrieved by a search engine according to their
similarity to the original question. We adapted our feature-based system for
Recognizing Question Entailment (RQE) to the question similarity task. Tested
on cQA-B-2016 test data, our RQE system outperformed the best system of the
2016 challenge in all measures with 77.47 MAP and 80.57 Accuracy. On cQA-B-2017
test data, performances of all systems dropped by around 30 points. Our primary
system obtained 44.62 MAP, 67.27 Accuracy and 47.25 F1 score. The cQA-B-2017
best system achieved 47.22 MAP and 42.37 F1 score. Our system is ranked sixth
in terms of MAP and third in terms of F1 out of 13 participating teams.
