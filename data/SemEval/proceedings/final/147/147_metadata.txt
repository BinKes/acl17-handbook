Abstract#==#This paper describes the submission of
team TSA-INF to SemEval-2017 Task 4
Subtask A. The submitted system is an
ensemble of three varying deep learning
architectures for sentiment analysis. The
core of the architecture is a convolutional
neural network that performs well on text
classification as is. The second subsystem
is a gated recurrent neural network implementation.
Additionally, the third system
integrates opinion lexicons directly into a
convolution neural network architecture.
The resulting ensemble of the three architectures
achieved a top ten ranking with
a macro-averaged recall of 64.3%. Additional
results comparing variations of
the submitted system are not conclusive
enough to determine a best architecture,
but serve as a benchmark for further implementations.
