Abstract#==#We describe our submissions for SemEval-2017 Task~8, Determining Rumour
Veracity and Support for Rumours. The Digital Curation Technologies (DKT) team
at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) participated
in two subtasks: Subtask A (determining the stance of a message) and Subtask B
(determining veracity of a message, closed variant). In both cases, our
implementation consisted of a Multivariate Logistic Regression (Maximum
Entropy) classifier coupled with hand-written patterns and rules (heuristics)
applied in a post-process cascading fashion. We provide a detailed analysis of
the system performance and report on variants of our systems that were not part
of the official submission.
