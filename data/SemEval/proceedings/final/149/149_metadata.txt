Abstract#==#This paper explores the role of semantic relatedness features, such as word
associations, in humour recognition. Specifically, we examine the task of
inferring pairwise humour judgments in Twitter hashtag wars. We examine a
variety of word association features derived from University of Southern
Florida Free Association Norms (USF) and the Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus
(EAT) and find that word association-based features outperform Word2Vec
similarity, a popular semantic relatedness measure. Our system achieves an
accuracy of 56.42% using a combination of unigram perplexity, bigram
perplexity, EAT difference (tweet-avg), USF forward (max), EAT difference
(word-avg), USF difference (word-avg), EAT forward (min), USF difference
(tweet-max), and EAT backward (min).
