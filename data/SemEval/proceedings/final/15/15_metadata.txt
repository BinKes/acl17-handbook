Abstract#==#This paper describes a system developed for a shared sentiment analysis task
and its subtasks organized by SemEval-2017. A key feature of our system is the
embedded ability to detect sarcasm in order to enhance the performance of
sentiment classification. We first constructed an
affect-cognition-sociolinguistics sarcasm features model and trained a
SVM-based classifier for detecting sarcastic expressions from general tweets.
For sentiment prediction, we developed CrystalNest-- a two-level cascade
classification system using features combining sarcasm score derived from our
sarcasm classifier, sentiment scores from Alchemy, NRC lexicon, n-grams, word
embedding vectors, and part-of-speech features. We found that the sarcasm
detection derived features consistently benefited key sentiment analysis
evaluation metrics, in different degrees, across four subtasks A-D.
