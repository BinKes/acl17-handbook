Abstract#==#Over 50 million scholarly articles have been published: they constitute a
unique repository of knowledge. In particular, one may infer from them
relations between scientific concepts. Artificial neural networks have recently
been explored for relation extraction. In this work, we continue this line of
work and present a system based on a convolutional neural network to extract
relations. Our model ranked first in the SemEval-2017 task 10 (ScienceIE) for
relation extraction in scientific articles (subtask C).
