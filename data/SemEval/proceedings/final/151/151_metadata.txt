Abstract#==#To address semantic similarity on multilingual and cross-lingual sentences, we
firstly translate other foreign languages into English, and then
feed our monolingual English system with various interactive features. Our
system is further supported by combining with deep learning semantic similarity
and our best run achieves the mean Pearson correlation 73.16\% in primary
track.
