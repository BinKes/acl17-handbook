Abstract#==#This paper describes the winning system for SemEval-2017 Task 6: #HashtagWars:
Learning a Sense of Humor. Humor detection has up until now been predominantly
addressed using feature-based approaches. Our system utilizes recurrent deep
learning methods with dense embeddings to predict humorous tweets from the
@midnight show #HashtagWars. In order to include both meaning and sound in the
analysis, GloVe embeddings are combined with a novel phonetic representation to
serve as input to an LSTM component. The output is combined with a
character-based CNN model, and an XGBoost component in an ensemble model which
achieves 0.675 accuracy on the evaluation data.
