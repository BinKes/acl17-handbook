Abstract#==#This paper describes our TTI-COIN system that participated in SemEval-2017 Task
10. We investigated appropriate embeddings to adapt a neural end-to-end entity
and relation extraction system LSTM-ER to this task. We participated in the
full task setting of the entity segmentation, entity classification and
relation classification (scenario 1) and the setting of relation classification
only (scenario 3). The system was directly applied to the scenario 1 without
modifying the codes thanks to its generality and flexibility. Our evaluation
results show that the choice of appropriate pre-trained embeddings affected the
performance significantly. With the best embeddings, our system was ranked
third in the scenario 1 with the micro F1 score of 0.38. We also confirm that
our system can produce the micro F1 score of 0.48 for the scenario 3 on the
test data, and this score is close to the score of the 3rd ranked system in the
task.
