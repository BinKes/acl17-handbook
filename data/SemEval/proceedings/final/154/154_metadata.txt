Abstract#==#This paper describes the system submitted to SemEval-2017 Task 4-A Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter developed by the UCSC-NLP team. We studied how
relationships between sense n-grams and sentiment polarities can contribute to
this task, i.e. co-occurrences of WordNet senses in the tweet, and the
polarity. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of discarding a large set of
features based on char-grams reported in preceding works. Based on these
elements, we developed a SVM system, which exploring SentiWordNet as a polarity
lexicon. It achieves an $F_1=0.624$ of average. Among $39$ submissions to this
task, we ranked $10th$.
