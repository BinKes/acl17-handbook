Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission to Task 5 of SemEval 2017, Fine-Grained
Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News, where we limit ourselves
to performing sentiment analysis on news headlines only (track 2). The approach
presented in this paper uses a Support Vector Machine to do the required
regression, and besides unigrams and a sentiment tool, we use various
ontology-based features. To this end we created a domain ontology that models
various concepts from the financial domain. This allows us to model the
sentiment of actions depending on which entity they are affecting (e.g.,
'decreasing debt' is positive, but 'decreasing profit' is negative). The
presented approach yielded a cosine distance of 0.6810 on the official test
data, resulting in the 12th position.
