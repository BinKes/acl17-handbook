Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe our proposed method for measuring semantic
similarity for a given pair of words at SemEval-2017 monolingual semantic word
similarity task. We use a combination of knowledge-based and corpus-based
techniques.
We use FarsNet, the Persian Word Net, besides deep learning techniques to
extract the similarity of words. We evaluated our proposed approach on Persian
(Farsi) test data at SemEval-2017. It outperformed the other participants and
ranked the first in the challenge.
