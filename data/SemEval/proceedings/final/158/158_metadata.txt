Abstract#==#This paper describes our proposed solution for SemEval 2017 Task 1: Semantic
Textual Similarity \cite{semeval2017}. The task aims at measuring the degree of
equivalence between sentences given in English. Performance is evaluated by
computing Pearson Correlation scores between the predicted scores and human
judgements. Our proposed system consists of two subsystems and one regression
model for predicting STS scores. The two subsystems are designed to learn
Paraphrase and Event Embeddings that can take the consideration of paraphrasing
characteristics and sentence structures into our system. The regression model
associates these embeddings to make the final predictions. The experimental
result shows that our system acquires 0.8 of Pearson Correlation Scores in this
task.
