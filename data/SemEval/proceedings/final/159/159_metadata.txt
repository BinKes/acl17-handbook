Abstract#==#This paper describes a text-ranking system developed by bunji team in
SemEval-2017 Task 3: Community Question Answering, Subtask A and C. The goal of
the task is to re-rank the comments in a question-and-answer forum such that
useful comments for answering the question are ranked high. We proposed a
method that combines neural similarity features and hand-crafted comment
plausibility features, and we modeled inter-comments relationship using
conditional random field. Our approach obtained the fifth place in the Subtask
A and the second place in the Subtask C.
