Abstract#==#This paper presents the system in SemEval-2017 Task 3, Community Question
Answering (CQA). We develop a ranking system that is capable of capturing
semantic relations between text pairs with little word overlap.  In addition to
traditional NLP features, we introduce several neural network based matching
features which enable our system to measure text similarity beyond lexicons.
Our system significantly outperforms baseline methods and holds the second
place in Subtask A and the fifth place in Subtask B, which demonstrates its
efficacy on answer selection and question retrieval.
