Abstract#==#This paper describes Sew-Embed, our language-independent approach to
multilingual and cross-lingual semantic word similarity as part of the
SemEval-2017 Task 2. We leverage the Wikipedia-based concept representations
developed by Raganato et al. (2016), and propose an embedded augmentation of
their explicit high-dimensional vectors, which we obtain by plugging in an
arbitrary word (or sense) embedding representation, and computing a weighted
average in the continuous vector space. We evaluate Sew-Embed with two
different off-the-shelf embedding representations, and report their
performances across all monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks available for
the task. Despite its simplicity, especially compared with supervised or overly
tuned approaches, Sew-Embed achieves competitive results in the cross-lingual
setting (3rd best result in the global ranking of subtask 2, score 0.56).
