Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our QU-BIGIR system for the Arabic subtask D of the
SemEval 2017 Task 3. Our approach builds on our participation in the past
version of the same subtask. This year, our system uses different similarity
measures that encodes lexical and semantic pairwise similarity of text pairs.
In addition to well known similarity measures such as cosine similarity, we use
other measures based on the summary statistics of word embedding
representation for a given text. To rank a list of candidate question answer
pairs for a given question, we learn a linear SVM classifier over our
similarity features. Our best resulting run came second in subtask D with a
very competitive performance to the first-ranking system.
