Abstract#==#This paper describes the systems we submitted to the task 3 (Community Ques-
tion Answering) in SemEval 2017 which contains three subtasks on English
corpora,
i.e., subtask A: Question-Comment Similarity, subtask B: Question-Question
Similarity, and subtask C: Question-External Comment Similarity. For subtask A,
we
combined two different methods to represent question-comment pair, i.e.,
supervised model using traditional features and Convolutional Neural Network.
For subtask B, we utilized the information of snippets returned from Search
Engine with question subject as query. For subtask C, we ranked the comments by
multiplying the probability of the pair related question comment being Good by
the reciprocal rank of the related question.
