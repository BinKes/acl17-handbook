Abstract#==#This paper describes our systems submitted to the Fine-Grained Sentiment
Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News task (i.e., Task 5) in SemEval-2017.
This task includes two subtasks in microblogs and news headline domain
respectively. To settle this problem, we extract four types of effective
features, including linguistic features, sentiment lexicon features,
domain-specific features and word embedding features. Then we employ these
features to construct models by using ensemble regression algorithms. Our
submissions rank 1st and rank 5th in subtask 1 and subtask 2 respectively.
