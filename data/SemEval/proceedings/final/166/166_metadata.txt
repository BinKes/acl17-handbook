Abstract#==#This paper reports our submission to subtask A of task 4 (Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter, SAT) in SemEval 2017, i.e., Message Polarity Classification. We

domain specific features and word embedding features together with supervised
machine learning methods to address this task. Officially released results
