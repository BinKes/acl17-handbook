Abstract#==#This paper describes our submissions to task 7 in SemEval 2017, i.e., Detection
and Interpretation of English Puns. We participated in the first two subtasks,
which are
to detect and locate English puns respectively. For subtask 1, we presented a
supervised system to determine whether or not a sentence contains a pun using
similarity features calculated on sense vectors or cluster center vectors. For
subtask 2, we established an unsupervised system to locate the pun by scoring
each word in the
sentence and we assumed that the word with the smallest score is the pun.
