Abstract#==#The majority of core techniques to solve many problems in Community Question
Answering (CQA) task rely on similarity computation. This work focuses on
similarity between two sentences (or questions in subtask B) based on word
embeddings. We exploit words importance levels in sentences or questions for
similarity features, for classification and ranking with machine learning.
Using only 2 types of similarity metric, our proposed method has shown
comparable results with other complex systems. This method on subtask B 2017
dataset is ranked on position 7 out of 13 participants. Evaluation on 2016
dataset is on position 8 of 12, outperforms some complex systems. Further, this
finding is explorable and potential to be used as baseline and extensible for
many tasks in CQA and other textual similarity based system.
