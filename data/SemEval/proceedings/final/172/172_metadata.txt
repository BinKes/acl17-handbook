Abstract#==#We use referential translation machines for predicting the semantic similarity
of text in all STS tasks which contain Arabic, English, Spanish, and Turkish
this year.
RTMs pioneer a language independent approach to semantic similarity and remove
the need to access 
any task or domain specific information or resource. RTMs become 6th out of 52
submissions in 
Spanish to English STS. 
We average prediction scores using weights based on the training performance to
improve the overall performance.
