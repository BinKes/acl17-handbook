Abstract#==#In this paper we introduce our system participating at the 2017 SemEval shared
task on keyphrase extraction from scientific documents.
We aimed at the creation of a keyphrase extraction approach which relies on as
little external resources as possible. Without applying any hand-crafted
external resources, and only utilizing a transformed version of word embeddings
trained at Wikipedia, our proposed system manages to perform among the best
participating systems in terms of precision.
