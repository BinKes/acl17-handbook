Abstract#==#In this paper we report our attempt to use, on the one hand, state-of-the-art
neural approaches that are proposed to measure Semantic Textual Similarity
(STS). On the other hand, we propose an unsupervised cross-word alignment
approach, which is linguistically motivated. The neural approaches proposed
herein are divided into two main stages. The first stage deals with
constructing neural word embeddings, the components of sentence embeddings. The
second stage deals with constructing a semantic similarity function relating
pairs of sentence embeddings. Unfortunately our competition results were poor
in all tracks, therefore we concentrated our research to improve them for Track
5 (EN-EN).
