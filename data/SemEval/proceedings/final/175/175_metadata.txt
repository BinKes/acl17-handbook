Abstract#==#This paper reports team IITPB's participation in the SemEval 2017 Task 5 on
`Fine-grained sentiment analysis on financial microblogs and news'. We
developed 2 systems for the two tracks. One system was based on an ensemble of
Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression. This system relied on
Distributional Thesaurus (DT), word embeddings and lexicon features to predict
a floating sentiment value between -1 and +1. The other system was based on
Support Vector Regression using word embeddings, lexicon features, and PMI
scores as features. The system was ranked 5th in track 1 and 8th in track 2.
