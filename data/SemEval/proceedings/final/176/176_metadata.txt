Abstract#==#In this  paper we propose an ensemble based model which combines state of the
art deep learning sentiment analysis algorithms like Convolution Neural Network
(CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) along with feature based models to
identify optimistic or pessimistic sentiments associated with companies and
stocks in financial texts. We build our system to participate in a competition
organized by Semantic Evaluation 2017 International Workshop. We combined
predictions from various models using an artificial neural network to determine
the opinion towards an entity in (a) Microblog Messages and (b) News Headlines
data. Our models achieved a cosine similarity score of 0.751 and 0.697 for the
above two tracks giving us the rank of 2nd and 7th best team respectively.
