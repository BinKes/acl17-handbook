Abstract#==#This paper presents the approach developed at the Faculty of Engineering of
University of Porto, to participate in SemEval 2017, Task 5: Fine-grained
Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News. 
The task consisted in predicting a real continuous variable from -1.0 to +1.0
representing the polarity and intensity of sentiment concerning
companies/stocks mentioned in short texts. We modeled the task as a regression
analysis problem and combined traditional techniques such as pre-processing
short texts, bag-of-words representations and lexical-based features with
enhanced financial specific bag-of-embeddings. We used an external collection
of tweets and news headlines mentioning companies/stocks from S\&P 500 to
create financial word embeddings which are able to capture domain-specific
syntactic and semantic similarities. The resulting approach obtained a cosine
similarity score of 0.69 in sub-task 5.1 - Microblogs and 0.68 in sub-task 5.2
- News Headlines.
