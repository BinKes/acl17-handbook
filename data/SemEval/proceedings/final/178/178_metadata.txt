Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2017 shared task of
determining question-question similarity in a community question-answering
setting (Task 3B). We extracted both syntactic and semantic similarity features
between candidate questions, performed pairwise-preference learning to optimize
for ranking order, and then trained a random forest classifier to predict
whether the candidate questions are paraphrases of each other. This approach
achieved a MAP of 45.7% out of max achievable 67.0% on the test set.
