Abstract#==#This document describes our participation in SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter. We have only reported results for subtask B - English,
determining the polarity towards a topic on a two point scale (positive or
negative sentiment). Our main contribution is the integration of user
information in the classification process. A SVM model is trained with Word2Vec
vectors from user's tweets extracted from his timeline. The obtained results
show that user-specific classifiers trained on tweets from user timeline can
introduce noise as they are error prone because they are classified by an
imperfect system. This encourages us to explore further integration of user
information for author-based Sentiment Analysis.
