Abstract#==#This paper introduces a new task on Multilingual and Cross-lingual SemanticThis
paper introduces a new task on Multilingual and Cross-lingual Semantic Word
Similarity which measures the semantic similarity of word pairs within and
across five languages: English, Farsi, German, Italian and Spanish. High
quality datasets were manually curated for the five languages with high
inter-annotator agreements (consistently in the 0.9 ballpark). These were used
for semi-automatic construction of ten cross-lingual datasets. 17 teams
participated in the task, submitting 24 systems in subtask 1 and 14 systems in
subtask 2. Results show that systems that combine statistical knowledge from
text corpora, in the form of word embeddings, and external knowledge from
lexical resources are best performers in both subtasks. More information can be
found on the task website: http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task2/
