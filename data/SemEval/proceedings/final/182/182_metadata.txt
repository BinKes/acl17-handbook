Abstract#==#Media is full of false claims. Even Oxford Dictionaries named “post-truth”
as the word of 2016. This makes it more important than ever to build systems
that can identify the veracity of a story, and the nature of the discourse
around it. RumourEval is a SemEval shared task that aims to identify and handle
rumours and reactions to them, in text. We present an annotation scheme, a
large dataset covering multiple topics – each having their own families of
claims and replies – and use these to pose two concrete challenges as well as
the results achieved by participants on these challenges.
