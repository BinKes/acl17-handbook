Abstract#==#We describe the SemEval task of extracting keyphrases and relations between
them from scientific documents, which is crucial for understanding which
publications describe which processes, tasks and materials. Although this was a
new task, we had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We
expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for
researchers working on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader
knowledge base population and information extraction communities.
