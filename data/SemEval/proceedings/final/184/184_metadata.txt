Abstract#==#A pun is a form of wordplay in which a word suggests two or more meanings by
exploiting polysemy, homonymy, or phonological similarity to another word, for
an intended humorous or rhetorical effect.  Though a recurrent and expected
feature in many discourse types, puns stymie traditional approaches to
computational lexical semantics because they violate their
one-sense-per-context assumption.  This paper describes the first competitive
evaluation for the automatic detection, location, and interpretation of puns. 
We describe the motivation for these tasks, the evaluation methods, and the
manually annotated data set.  Finally, we present an overview and discussion of
the participating systems' methodologies, resources, and results.
