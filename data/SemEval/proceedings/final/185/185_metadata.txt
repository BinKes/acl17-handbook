Abstract#==#This paper discusses the "Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial
Microblogs and News" task as part of SemEval-2017, specifically under the
"Detecting sentiment, humour, and truth" theme. This task contains two tracks,
where the first one concerns Microblog messages and the second one covers News
Statements and Headlines. The main goal behind both tracks was to predict the
sentiment score for each of the mentioned companies/stocks. The sentiment
scores for each text instance adopted floating point values in the range of -1
(very negative/bearish) to 1 (very positive/bullish), with 0 designating
neutral sentiment. This task attracted a total of 32 participants, with 25
participating in Track 1 and 29 in Track 2.
