Abstract#==#In this report we summarize the results of the 2017 AMR SemEval shared task.
The task consisted of two separate yet related subtasks. In the parsing
subtask, participants were asked to produce Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) graphs for a set of English sentences in the
biomedical domain. In the generation subtask, participants were asked to
generate English sentences given AMR graphs in the news/forum domain. A total
of five sites participated in the parsing subtask, and four participated in the
generation subtask. 
Along with a description of the task and the participants' systems, we show
various score ablations and some sample outputs.
