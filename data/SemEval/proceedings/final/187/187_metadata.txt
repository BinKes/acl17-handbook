Abstract#==#This paper describes the fifth year of the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task.
SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a rerun of the subtasks of SemEval-2016 Task
4, which include identifying the overall sentiment of the tweet, sentiment
towards a topic with classification on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal
scale, and quantification of the distribution of sentiment towards a topic
across a number of tweets: again on a two-point and on a five-point ordinal
scale. Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we introduced a new language,
Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii) we made available information from the
profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target tweets. The task continues
to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams participating this year.
