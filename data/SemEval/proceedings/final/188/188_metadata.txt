Abstract#==#Clinical TempEval 2017 aimed to answer the question: how well do systems
trained on annotated timelines for one medical condition (colon cancer) perform
in predicting timelines on another medical condition (brain cancer)? Nine
sub-tasks were included, covering problems in time expression identification,
event expression identification and temporal relation identification. 
Participant systems were evaluated on clinical and pathology notes from Mayo
Clinic cancer patients, annotated with an extension of TimeML for the clinical
domain. 11 teams participated in the tasks, with the best systems achieving F1
scores above 0.55 for time expressions, above 0.70 for event expressions, and
above 0.40 for temporal relations. Most tasks observed about a 20 point drop
over Clinical TempEval 2016, where systems were trained and evaluated on the
same domain (colon cancer).
