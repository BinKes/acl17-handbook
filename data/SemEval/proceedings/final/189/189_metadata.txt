Abstract#==#This paper describes a new shared task for humor understanding that attempts to
eschew the ubiquitous binary approach to humor detection and focus on
comparative humor ranking instead. The task is based on a new dataset of funny
tweets posted in response to shared hashtags, collected from the `Hashtag Wars'
segment of the TV show @midnight. The results are evaluated in two subtasks
that require the participants to generate either the correct pairwise
comparisons of tweets (subtask A), or the correct ranking of the tweets
(subtask B) in terms of how funny they are. 7 teams participated in subtask A,
and 5 teams participated in subtask B. The best accuracy in subtask A was
0.675. The best (lowest) rank edit distance for subtask B was 0.872.
