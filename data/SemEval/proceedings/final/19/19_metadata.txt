Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe a methodology to infer Bullish or Bearish sentiment
towards companies/brands. More specifically, our approach leverages affective
lexica and word embeddings in combination with convolutional neural networks to
infer the sentiment of financial news headlines towards a target company. Such
architecture was used and evaluated in the context of the SemEval 2017
challenge (task 5, subtask 2), in which it obtained the best performance.
