Abstract#==#This paper describes the system used by the team LIPN in SemEval 2017 Task 10:
Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications. The team
participated in Scenario 1, that includes three subtasks, Identification of
keyphrases (Subtask A), Classification of identified keyphrases (Subtask B) and
Extraction of relationships between two identified keyphrases (Subtask C). The
presented system was mainly focused on the use of part-of-speech tag sequences
to filter candidate keyphrases for Subtask A. Subtasks A and B were addressed
as a sequence labeling problem using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and even
though Subtask C was out of the scope of this approach, one rule was included
to identify synonyms.
