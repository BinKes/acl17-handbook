Abstract#==#Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the meaning similarity of sentences.
Applications include machine translation (MT), summarization, generation,
question answering (QA), short answer grading, semantic search, dialog and
conversational systems. The STS shared task is a venue for assessing the
current state-of-the-art. The 2017 task focuses on multilingual and
cross-lingual pairs with one sub-track exploring MT quality estimation (MTQE)
data. The task obtained strong participation from 31 teams, with 17
participating in \emph{all  language tracks}. We summarize performance and
review a selection of well performing methods. Analysis highlights common
errors, providing insight into the limitations of existing models. To support
ongoing work on semantic representations, the {\em STS Benchmark} is introduced
as a new shared training and evaluation set carefully selected from the corpus
of English STS shared task data (2012-2017).
