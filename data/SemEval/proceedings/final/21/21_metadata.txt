Abstract#==#This paper describes our system, dubbed MoRS (Modular Ranking System),
pronounced 'Morse', which participated in Task 3 of SemEval-2017. 
We used MoRS to perform the Community Question Answering Task 3, which
consisted on reordering a set of comments according to their usefulness in
answering the question in the thread. This was made for a large collection of
questions created by a user community.
As for this challenge we wanted to go back to simple, easy-to-use, and somewhat
forgotten technologies that we think, in the hands of non-expert people, could
be reused in their own data sets. Some of our techniques included the
annotation of text, the retrieval of meta-data for each comment, POS tagging
and Named Entity Recognition, among others. These gave place to syntactical
analysis and semantic measurements. Finally we show and discuss our results and
the context of our approach, which is part of a more comprehensive system in
development, named MoQA.
