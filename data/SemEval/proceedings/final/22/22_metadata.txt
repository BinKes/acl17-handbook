Abstract#==#The paper presents a system for locating a pun word. The developed method
calculates a score for each word in a pun, using a number of components,
including its Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Normalized Pointwise Mutual
Information (NPMI) with other words in the pun text, its position in the text,
part-of-speech and some syntactic features. The method achieved the best
performance in the Heterographic category and the second best in the
Homographic. Further analysis showed that IDF is the most useful
characteristic, whereas the count of words with which the given word has high
NPMI has a negative effect on performance.
