Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for subtask-A: SDQC for RumourEval, task-8 of
SemEval 2017. Identifying rumours, especially for breaking news events as they
unfold, is a challenging task due to the absence of sufficient information
about the exact rumour stories circulating on social media. Determining the
stance of Twitter users towards rumourous messages could provide an indirect
way of identifying potential rumours. The proposed approach makes use of topic
independent features from two categories, namely cue features and message
specific features to fit a gradient boosting classifier. With an accuracy of
0.78, our system achieved the second best performance on subtask-A of
RumourEval.
