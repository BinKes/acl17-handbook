Abstract#==#The system developed by the SSN_MLRG1 team for Semeval-2017 task 5 on
fine-grained sentiment analysis uses Multiple Kernel Gaussian Process for
identifying the optimistic and pessimistic sentiments associated with companies
and stocks. Since the comments made at different times about the same companies
and stocks may display different emotions, their properties such as smoothness
and periodicity may vary. Our experiments show that while single kernel
Gaussian Process can learn certain properties well, Multiple Kernel Gaussian
Process are effective in learning the presence of different properties
simultaneously.
