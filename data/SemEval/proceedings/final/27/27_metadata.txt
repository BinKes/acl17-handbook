Abstract#==#This study proposes a system to participate in the Clinical TempEval 2017
shared task, a part of the SemEval 2017 Tasks. Domain adaptation was the main
challenge this year. We took part in the supervised domain adaption where data
of 591 records of colon cancer patients and 30 records of brain cancer patients
from Mayo clinic were given and we are asked to analyze the records from brain
cancer patients. Based on the THYME corpus released by the organizer of
Clinical TempEval, we propose a framework that automatically analyzes clinical
temporal events in a fine-grained level. Support vector machine (SVM) and
conditional random field (CRF) were implemented in our system for different
subtasks, including detecting clinical relevant events and time expression,
determining their attributes, and identifying their relations with each other
within the document. The results showed the capability of domain
adaptation of our system.
