Abstract#==#This paper presents the details of our system
IBA-Sys that participated in SemEval
Task: Fine-grained sentiment analysis on
Financial Microblogs and News. Our system
participated in both tracks. For microblogs
track, a supervised learning approach
was adopted and the regressor was
trained using XgBoost regression algorithm
on lexicon features. For news headlines
track, an ensemble of regressors was
used to predict sentiment score. One regressor
was trained using TF-IDF features
and another was trained using the n-gram
features. The source code is available at
Github 1.
