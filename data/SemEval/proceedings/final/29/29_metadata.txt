Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our attempt at producing a state-of-the-art Twitter
sentiment classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short
Term Memory (LSTMs) networks.  Our system leverages a large amount of unlabeled
data to pre-train word embeddings.  We then use a subset of the unlabeled data
to fine tune the embeddings using distant supervision.                          The
final
CNNs
and
LSTMs are trained on the SemEval-2017 Twitter dataset where the embeddings are
fined tuned again.  To boost performances we ensemble several CNNs and LSTMs
together. Our approach achieved first rank on all of the five English subtasks
amongst 40 teams.
