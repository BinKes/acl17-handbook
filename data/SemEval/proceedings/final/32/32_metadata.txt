Abstract#==#We describe our system for participating in SemEval-2017 Task 3 on Community
Question Answering. Our approach relies on combining a rich set of various
types
of features: semantic and metadata. The most important group turned out to be
the
metadata feature and the semantic vectors trained on QatarLiving data. In the
main
Subtask C, our primary submission was ranked fourth, with a MAP of 13.48 and
accuracy of 97.08. In Subtask A, our primary submission get into the top 50%.
