Abstract#==#This paper describes the improvements that we have applied on CAMR baseline
parser (Wang et al., 2016) at Task 8 of SemEval-2016. Our objective is to
increase the performance of CAMR when parsing sentences from scientific
articles, especially articles of biology domain more accurately. To achieve
this goal, we built two wrapper layers for CAMR. The first layer, which covers
the input data, will normalize, add necessary information to the input
sentences to make the input dependency parser and the aligner better handle
reference citations, scientific figures, formulas, etc. The second layer, which
covers the output data, will modify and standardize output data based on a list
of scientific concept fixing patterns. This will help CAMR better handle
biological concepts which are not in the training dataset. Finally, after
applying our approach, CAMR has scored 0.65 F-score on the test set of
Biomedical training data and 0.61 F-score on the official blind test dataset.
