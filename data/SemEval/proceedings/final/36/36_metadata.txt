Abstract#==#Temporality is crucial in understanding the course of clinical events from a
patient’s electronic health recordsand temporal processing is becoming more
and more important for improving access to content.SemEval 2017 Task 12
(Clinical TempEval) addressed this challenge using the THYME corpus, a corpus
of clinical narratives annotated with a schema based on TimeML2 guidelines. We
developed and evaluated approaches for: extraction of temporal expressions
(TIMEX3) and EVENTs; EVENT attributes; document-time relations. Our approach is
a hybrid model which is based on rule based methods, semi-supervised learning,
and semantic features with addition of manually crafted rules.
