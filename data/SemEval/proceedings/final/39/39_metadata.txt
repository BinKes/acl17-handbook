Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our contribution in SemEval 2017 international
workshop. We have tackled task 4 entitled “Sentiment analysis in Twitter”,
specifically subtask 4A-Arabic. We propose two Arabic sentiment classification
models implemented using supervised and unsupervised learning strategies. In
both models, Arabic tweets were preprocessed first then various schemes of
bag-of-N-grams were extracted to be used as features.
The final submission was selected upon the best performance achieved by the
supervised learning-based model. However, the results obtained by the
unsupervised learning-based model are considered promising and evolvable if
more rich lexica are adopted in further work.
