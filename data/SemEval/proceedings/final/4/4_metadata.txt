Abstract#==#This paper presents our submission to SemEval-2017 Task 6: #HashtagWars:
Learning a Sense of Humor. There are two subtasks: A. Pairwise Comparison, and
B. Semi-Ranking. Our assumption is that the distribution of humorous and
non-humorous texts in real life language is naturally imbalanced. Using Na√Øve
Bayes Multinomial with standard text-representation features, we approached
Subtask B as a sequence of imbalanced classification problems, and optimized
our system per the macro-average recall. Subtask A was then solved via the
Semi-Ranking results. On the final test, our system was ranked 10th for Subtask
A, and 3rd for Subtask B.
