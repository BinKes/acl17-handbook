Abstract#==#We present a neural encoder-decoder AMR parser that extends an attention-based
model by predicting the alignment between graph nodes and sentence tokens
explicitly with a pointer mechanism. Candidate lemmas are predicted as a
pre-processing step so that the lemmas of lexical concepts, as well as constant
strings, are factored out of the graph linearization and recovered through the
predicted alignments. The approach does not rely on syntactic parses or
extensive external resources. Our parser obtained 59% Smatch on the SemEval
test set.
