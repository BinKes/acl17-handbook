Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission for
the ScienceIE shared task (SemEval-
2017 Task 10) on entity and relation
extraction from scientific papers. Our
model is based on the end-to-end relation
extraction model of Miwa and Bansal
(2016) with several enhancements such as
semi-supervised learning via neural language
models, character-level encoding,
gazetteers extracted from existing knowledge
bases, and model ensembles. Our of-
ficial submission ranked first in end-to-end
entity and relation extraction (scenario 1),
and second in the relation-only extraction
(scenario 3).
