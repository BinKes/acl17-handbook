Abstract#==#We describe our system (DT Team) submitted at SemEval-2017 Task 1, Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) challenge for English (Track 5). We developed three
different models with various features including similarity scores calculated
using word and chunk alignments, word/sentence embeddings, and Gaussian Mixture
Model(GMM). The correlation between our systemâ€™s output and the human
judgments were up to 0.8536, which is more than 10% above baseline, and almost
as good as the best performing system which was at 0.8547 correlation (the
difference is just about 0.1%). Also, our system produced leading results when
evaluated with a separate STS benchmark dataset. The word alignment and
sentence embeddings based features were found to be very effective.
