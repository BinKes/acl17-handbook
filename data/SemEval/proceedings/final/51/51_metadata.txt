Abstract#==#We describe a method of calculating the similarity of questions in community
QA. Question in cQA are usually very long and there are a lot of useless
information about calculating the similarity of questions. Therefore,we
implement a CNN model based on similar and dissimilar information between
question’s keywords. We extract the keywords of questions, and then model the
similar and dissimilar information between the keywords, and use the CNN model
to calculate the similarity.
