Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach to the SemEval-2017 ``Semantic Textual
Similarity'' and ``Multilingual Word Similarity'' tasks. In the former, we test
our approach in both English and Spanish, and use a linguistically-rich set of
features. These move from lexical to semantic features. In particular, we try
to take advantage of the recent Abstract Meaning Representation and SMATCH
measure. Although without state of the art results, we introduce semantic
structures in textual similarity and analyze their impact. Regarding word
similarity, we target the English language and combine WordNet information with
Word Embeddings. Without matching the best systems, our approach proved to be
simple and effective.
