Abstract#==#This paper presents a system developed for SemEval-2017 Task 7, Detection and
Interpretation of English Puns consisting of three subtasks; pun detection, pun
location, and pun interpretation, respectively. The system stands on
recognizing a distinctive word which has a high association with the pun in the
given sentence. The intended humorous meaning of pun is identified through the
use of this word. Our official results confirm the potential of this approach.
