Abstract#==#A CNN method for sentiment classification task in Task 4A of SemEval 2017 is
presented. To solve the problem of word2vec training word vector slowly, a
method of training word vector by integrating word2vec and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) is proposed. This training method not only improves the training
speed of word2vec, but also makes the word vector more effective for the target
task. Furthermore, the word2vec adopts a full connection between the input
layer and the projection layer of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) for
acquiring the semantic information of the original sentence.
