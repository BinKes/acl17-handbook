Abstract#==#This paper describes the SimBow system submitted at SemEval2017-Task3, for the
question-question similarity subtask B. The proposed approach is a supervised
combination of different unsupervised textual similarities. These textual
similarities rely on the introduction of a relation matrix in the classical
cosine similarity between bag-of-words, so as to get a soft-cosine that takes
into account relations between words. According to the type of relation matrix
embedded in the soft-cosine, semantic or lexical relations can be considered.
Our system ranked first among the official submissions of subtask B.
