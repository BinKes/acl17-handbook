Abstract#==#This paper describes FCICU team systems that participated in SemEval-2017
Semantic Textual Similarity task (Task1) for monolingual and cross-lingual
sentence pairs. A sense-based language independent textual similarity approach
is presented, in which a proposed alignment similarity method coupled with new
usage of a semantic network (BabelNet) is used. Additionally, a previously
proposed integration between sense-based and sur-face-based semantic textual
similarity approach is applied together with our proposed approach. For all the
tracks in Task1, Run1 is a string kernel with alignments metric and Run2 is a
sense-based alignment similarity method. The first run is ranked 10th, and the
second is ranked 12th in the primary track, with correlation 0.619 and 0.617
respectively
