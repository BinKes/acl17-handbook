Abstract#==#This paper describes our convolutional neural network (CNN) system for Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) task. We calculated semantic similarity score between
two sentences by comparing their semantic vectors. We generated semantic vector
of every sentence by max pooling every dimension of their word vectors. There
are mainly two trick points in our system. One is that we trained a CNN to
transfer GloVe word vectors to a more proper form for STS task before pooling.
Another is that we trained a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) to transfer
difference of two semantic vectors to probability of every similarity score. We
decided all hyper parameters empirically. In spite of the simplicity of our
neural network system, we achieved a good accuracy and ranked 3rd in primary
track of SemEval 2017.
