Abstract#==#We present NTNU's systems for Task A (prediction of keyphrases) and Task B
(labelling as Material, Process or Task) at SemEval 2017 Task 10: Extracting
Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications
\cite{augenstein2017scienceie}. Our approach relies on supervised machine
learning using Conditional Random Fields. Our system yields a micro F-score of
0.34 for Tasks A and B combined on the test data. For Task C (relation
extraction), we relied on an independently developed system described in
\cite{Barik:2017}. For the full Scenario 1 (including relations), our approach
reaches a micro F-score of 0.33 (5th place). Here we describe our systems,
report results and discuss errors.
