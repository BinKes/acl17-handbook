Abstract#==#This paper describes SiTAKA, our system that has been used in task 4A, English
and Arabic languages, Sentiment Analysis in Twitter of SemEval2017. The system
proposes the representation of tweets using a novel set of features, which
include a bag of negated words and the information provided by some lexicons.
The polarity of tweets is determined by a classifier based on a Support Vector
Machine. Our system ranks 2nd among 8 systems in the Arabic language tweets and
ranks 8th among 38 systems in the English-language tweets.
