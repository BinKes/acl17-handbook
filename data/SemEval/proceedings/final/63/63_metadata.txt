Abstract#==#This article describes our proposed system  named LIM-LIG. This system is
designed for SemEval 2017 Task1: Semantic  Textual  Similarity (Track1).
LIM-LIG  proposes  an  innovative  enhancement to word embedding-based model 
devoted  to    measure                                            the  semantic 
similarity

     in 

Arabic 
sentences.
The  main  idea  is  to  exploit    the  word representations  as  vectors  in 
a  multidimensional  space    to    capture  the  semantic  and  syntactic 
properties  of                                              words.                       
IDF 
weighting   

and 
Part-of-Speech                                tagging            
    are 
applied  on  the  examined  sentences  to  support    the  identification  of 
words  that  are  highly  descriptive  in  each  sentence.  LIM-LIG system
achieves a Pearson\'s correlation of 0.74633, ranking 2nd among all
participants in the   Arabic monolingual pairs
