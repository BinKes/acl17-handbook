Abstract#==#The SSN MLRG1 team for Semeval-2017 task 4 has applied Gaussian Process, with
bag of words feature vectors and fixed rule multi-kernel learning, for
sentiment analysis of tweets. Since tweets on the same topic, made at different
times, may exhibit different emotions, their properties such as smoothness and
periodicity also vary with time. Our experiments show that, compared to single
kernel, multiple kernels are effective in learning the simultaneous presence of
multiple properties.
