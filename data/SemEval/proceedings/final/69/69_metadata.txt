Abstract#==#This paper describes a supervised solution for detecting the polarity scores of
tweets or headline news in the financial domain, submitted to the SemEval 2017
Fine-Grained Sentiment Analysis on Financial Microblogs and News Task. The
premise is that it is possible to understand market reaction over a company
stock by measuring the positive/negative sentiment contained in the financial
tweets and news headlines, where polarity is measured in a continuous scale
ranging from -1.0 (very bearish) to 1.0 (very bullish). Our system receives as
input the textual content of tweets or news headlines, together with their ids,
stock cashtag or name of target company, and the polarity score gold standard
for the training dataset. Our solution retrieves features from these text
instances using n-gram, hashtags, sentiment score calculated by a external APIs
and others features to train a regression model capable to detect continuous
score of these sentiments with precision.
