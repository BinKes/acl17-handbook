Abstract#==#In this paper we present the system for Answer Selection and Ranking in
Community Question Answering, which we build as part of our participation in
SemEval-2017 Task 3. We develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based system
that makes use of textual, domain-specific, word-embedding and topic-modeling
features.
In addition, we propose a novel method for dialogue chain identification in
comment threads. Our primary submission won subtask C, outperforming other
systems in all the primary evaluation metrics. We performed well in other
English subtasks, ranking third in subtask A and eighth in subtask B. We also
developed open source toolkits for all the three English subtasks by the name
cQARank [https://github.com/TitasNandi/cQARank].
