Abstract#==#This is the Lump team participation at SemEval 2017 Task 1 on Semantic Textual
Similarity. Our supervised model relies on features which are multilingual or
interlingual in nature. We include lexical similarities, cross-language
explicit semantic analysis, internal representations of multilingual neural
networks and interlingual word embeddings. Our representations allow to use
large datasets in language pairs with many instances to better classify
instances in smaller language pairs avoiding the necessity of translating into
a single language. Hence we can deal with all the languages in the task:
Arabic, English, Spanish, and Turkish.
