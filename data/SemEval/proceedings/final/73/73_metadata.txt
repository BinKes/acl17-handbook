Abstract#==#This paper reports the details of our submissions in the task 1 of SemEval
2017. This task aims at assessing the semantic textual similarity of two
sentences or texts. We submit three unsupervised systems based on word
embeddings. The differences between these runs are the various preprocessing on
evaluation data. The best performance of these systems on the evaluation of
Pearson correlation is 0.6887. Unsurprisingly, results of our runs demonstrate
that data preprocessing, such as tokenization, lemmatization, extraction of
content words and removing stop words, is helpful and plays a significant role
in improving the performance of models.
