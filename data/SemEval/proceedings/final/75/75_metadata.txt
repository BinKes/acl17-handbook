Abstract#==#This paper describes our system participating in the SemEval-2017 Task 7, for
the subtasks of homographic pun location and homographic pun interpretation.
For pun interpretation, we use a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation
(WSD) method based on sense embeddings. Pun-based jokes can be divided into two
parts, each containing information about the two distinct senses of the pun. To
exploit this structure we split the context that is input to the WSD system
into two local contexts and find the best sense for each of them. We use the
output of pun interpretation for pun location. As we expect the two meanings of
a pun to be very dissimilar, we compute sense embedding cosine distances for
each sense-pair and select the word that has the highest distance. We describe
experiments on different methods of splitting the context and compare our
method to several baselines. We find evidence supporting our hypotheses and
obtain competitive results for pun interpretation.
