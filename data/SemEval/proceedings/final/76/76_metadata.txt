Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis is one of the central issues in Natural Language Processing
and has become more and more important in many fields. Typical sentiment
analysis classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes
(e.g.,positive or negative). In this paper we describe our deep learning
system(combining GRU and SVM) to solve both two-, three- and five- tweet
polarity classifications. We first trained a gated recurrent neural network
using pre-trained word embeddings, then we extracted features from GRU layer
and input these features into support vector machine to fulfill both the
classification and quantification subtasks. The proposed approach achieved
37th, 19th, and 14rd places in subtasks A, B and C, respectively.
