Abstract#==#This paper shows the details of our system submissions in the task 2 of SemEval
2017. We take part in the subtask 1 of this task, which is an English
monolingual subtask. This task is designed to evaluate the semantic word
similarity of two linguistic items. The results of runs are assessed by
standard Pearson and Spearman correlation, contrast with official gold standard
set. The best performance of our runs is 0.781 (Final). The techniques of our
runs mainly make use of the word embeddings and the knowledge-based method. The
results demonstrate that the combined method is effective for the computation
of word similarity, while the word embeddings and the knowledge-based
technique, respectively, needs more deeply improvement in details.
