Abstract#==#This paper presents three systems for semantic textual similarity (STS)
evaluation at SemEval-2017 STS task. One is an unsupervised system and the
other two are supervised systems which simply employ the unsupervised one. All
our systems mainly depend on the (SIS), which is constructed based on the
semantic hierarchical taxonomy in WordNet, to compute non-overlapping
information content (IC) of sentences. Our team ranked 2nd among 31
participating teams by the primary score of Pearson correlation coefficient
(PCC) mean of 7 tracks and achieved the best performance on Track 1 (AR-AR)
dataset.
