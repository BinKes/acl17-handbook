Abstract#==#Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) devotes to measuring the degree of
equivalence in the underlying semantic of the sentence pair. We proposed a new
system, ITNLP-AiKF, which applies in the SemEval 2017 Task1 Semantic Textual
Similarity track 5 English monolingual pairs. In our system, rich features are
involved, including Ontology based, word embedding based, Corpus based,
Alignment based and Literal based feature. We leveraged the features to predict
sentence pair similarity by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. In the
result, a Pearson Correlation of 0.8231 is achieved by our system, which is a
competitive result in the contest of this track.
