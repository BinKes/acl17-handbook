Abstract#==#We describes deep neural networks frameworks in this paper to address the
community question answering (cQA) ranking task (SemEval-2017 task 3).
Convolutional neural networks and bi-directional long-short term memory
networks are applied in our methods to extract semantic information from
questions and answers (comments). In addition, in order to take the full
advantage of question-comment semantic relevance, we deploy interaction layer
and augmented features before calculating the similarity. The results show that
our methods have the great effectiveness for both subtask A and subtask C.
