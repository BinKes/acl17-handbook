Abstract#==#This paper describes the system presented by the LABDA group at SemEval 2017
Task 10 ScienceIE, specifically for the subtasks of identification and
classification of keyphrases from scientific articles.
  For the task of identification, we use the BANNER tool, a named entity
recognition system, which
  is based on conditional random fields (CRF) and has obtained successful
results in the biomedical domain. To classify keyphrases, we study the UMLS
semantic network and propose a possible linking between the keyphrase types and
the UMLS semantic groups. Based on this semantic linking, we create a
dictionary for each keyphrase type. Then, a feature indicating if a token is
found in one of these dictionaries is incorporated to feature set used by the
BANNER tool. The final results on the test dataset show that our system 
  still needs to be improved, but the conditional random fields and,
consequently, 
  the BANNER system can be used as a first approximation to identify and
classify 
  keyphrases.
