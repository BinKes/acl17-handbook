Abstract#==#This study describes the design of the NTNU system for the ScienceIE task at
the SemEval 2017 workshop. We use self-defined feature templates and multiple
conditional random fields with extracted features to identify keyphrases along
with categorized labels and their relations from scientific publications. A
total of 16 teams participated in evaluation scenario 1 (subtasks A, B, and C),
with only 7 teams competing in all sub-tasks. Our best micro-averaging F1
across the three subtasks is 0.23, ranking in the middle among all 16
submissions.
