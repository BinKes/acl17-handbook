Abstract#==#This paper describes the XJSA System submission from XJTU. Our system was
created for SemEval2017 Task 4 â€“ subtask A which is very popular and
fundamental. The system is based on convolutional neural network and word
embedding. We used two pre-trained word vectors and adopt a dynamic strategy
for k-max pooling.
