Abstract#==#This paper describes a neural-network model which performed competitively (top
6) at the SemEval 2017 cross-lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task.
Our system employs an attention-based recurrent neural network model that
optimizes the sentence similarity. In this paper, we describe our participation
in the multilingual STS task which measures similarity across English, Spanish,
and Arabic.
