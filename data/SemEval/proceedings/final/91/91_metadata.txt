Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach for SemEval-2017 Task 4 - Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter (SAT). Its five subtasks are divided into two categories: (1)
sentiment classification, i.e., predicting topic-based tweet sentiment
polarity, and (2) sentiment quantification, that is, estimating the sentiment
distributions of a set of given tweets. We build a convolutional sentence
classification system for the task of SAT. Official results show that the
experimental results of our system are comparative.
