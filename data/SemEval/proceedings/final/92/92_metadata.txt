Abstract#==#By addressing both text-to-AMR parsing and AMR-to-text generation, SemEval-2017
Task 9 established AMR as a powerful semantic interlingua. We strengthen the
interlingual aspect of AMR by applying the multilingual Grammatical Framework
(GF) for AMR-to-text generation. Our current rule-based GF approach completely
covered only 12.3% of the test AMRs, therefore we combined it with
state-of-the-art JAMR Generator to see if the combination increases or
decreases the overall performance. The combined system achieved the automatic
BLEU score of 18.82 and the human Trueskill score of 107.2, to be compared to
the plain JAMR Generator results. As for AMR parsing, we added NER extensions
to our SemEval-2016 general-domain AMR parser to handle the biomedical genre,
rich in organic compound names, achieving Smatch F1=54.0%.
