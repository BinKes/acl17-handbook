Abstract#==#This paper describes the approach we used for SemEval-2017 Task 4: Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter. Topic-based (target-dependent) sentiment analysis has
become attractive and been used in some applications recently, but it is still
a challenging research task. In our approach, we take the left and right
context of a target into consideration when generating polarity classification
features.  We use two types of word embeddings in our classifiers: the general
word embeddings learned from 200 million tweets, and sentiment-specific word
embeddings learned from 10 million tweets using distance supervision.  We also
incorporate a text feature model in our algorithm. This model produces features
based on text negation, tf.idf weighting scheme, and a Rocchio text
classification method. We participated in four subtasks (B, C, D & E for
English), all of which are about topic-based message polarity classification.
Our team is ranked #6 in subtask B, #3 by MAEu and #9 by MAEm in subtask C, #3
using RAE and #6 using KLD in subtask D, and #3 in subtask E.
