Abstract#==#This paper describes the KeLP system participating in the SemEval-2017
community Question Answering (cQA) task.
The system is a refinement of the kernel-based sentence pair modeling we
proposed for the previous year challenge. It is implemented within the
Kernel-based Learning Platform called KeLP, from which we inherit the team's
name. 
Our primary submission ranked first in subtask A, and third in subtasks B and
C, being the only systems appearing in the top-3 ranking for all the English
subtasks. This shows that the proposed framework, which has minor variations
among the three subtasks, is extremely flexible and effective in tackling
learning tasks defined on sentence pairs.
