Abstract#==#Task 5 of SemEval-2017 involves fine-grained sentiment analysis on financial
microblogs and news.  Our solution for determining the sentiment score extends
an earlier convolutional neural network for sentiment analysis in several ways.
 We explicitly encode a focus on a particular company, we apply a data
augmentation   scheme, and use a larger data collection to complement the small
training data provided by the task organizers.                          The best
results
were
achieved
by training a model on an external dataset and then tuning it using the
provided training dataset.
