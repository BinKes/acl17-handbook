Abstract#==#In this paper we present two deep-learning systems that competed at
SemEval-2017 Task 4 “Sentiment Analysis in Twitter”. We participated in all
subtasks for English tweets, involving message-level and topic-based sentiment
polarity classification and quantification. We use Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks augmented with two kinds of attention mechanisms, on top of
word embeddings pre-trained on a big collection of Twitter messages. Also, we
present a text processing tool suitable for social network messages, which
performs tokenization, word normalization, segmentation and spell correction.
Moreover, our approach uses no hand-crafted features or sentiment lexicons. We
ranked 1st (tie) in Subtask A, and achieved very competitive results in the
rest of the Subtasks. Both the word embeddings and our text processing tool are
available to the research community.
