Abstract#==#In this paper, we present MayoNLP's results from the participation in the
ScienceIE share task at SemEval 2017. We focused on the keyphrase
classification task (Subtask B). We explored 
semantic similarities and patterns of keyphrases in scientific publications
using pre-trained word embedding models. Word Embedding Distance Pattern, which
uses the head noun word embedding to generate distance patterns based on
labeled keyphrases, is proposed as an incremental feature set to enhance the
conventional Named Entity Recognition feature sets.  Support vector machine is
used as the supervised classifier for keyphrase classification.
Our system achieved an overall F1 score of 0.67 for keyphrase classification
and 0.64 for keyphrase classification and relation detection.
