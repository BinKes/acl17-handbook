Abstract#==#Recently, different systems which learn to populate and extend a knowledge base
(KB) from the web in different languages have been presented. Although a large
set of concepts should be learnt independently from the language used to read,
there are facts which are expected to be more easily gathered in local language
(e.g., culture or geography). A system that merges KBs learnt in different
languages will benefit from the complementary information as long as common
beliefs are identified, as well as from redundancy present in web pages written
in different languages. In this paper, we deal with the problem of identifying
equivalent beliefs (or concepts) across language specific KBs, assuming that
they share the same ontology of categories and relations. In a case study with
two KBs independently learnt from different inputs, namely web pages written in
English and web pages written in Portuguese respectively, we report on the
results of two methodologies: an approach based on personalized PageRank and an
inference technique to find out common relevant paths through the KBs. The
proposed inference technique efficiently identifies relevant paths,
outperforming the baseline (a dictionary-based classifier) in the vast majority
of tested categories.
