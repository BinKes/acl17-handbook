Abstract#==#In this paper, we present an empirical study of email classification into
  two main categories ``Business" and ``Personal".  We train on the Enron
  email corpus, and test on the Enron and Avocado email corpora. We show
  that information from the email exchange networks improves the
  performance of classification. We represent the email exchange networks
  as social networks with
  graph structures. For this classification task, we extract social
  networks features from the graphs in addition to lexical features from
  email content and we compare the performance of SVM and Extra-Trees
  classifiers using these features.  Combining graph features with lexical
  features improves the performance on both classifiers. We also provide
  manually annotated sets of the Avocado and Enron email corpora as
  a supplementary contribution.
