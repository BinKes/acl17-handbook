Abstract#==#This paper introduces a new, graph-based view of the data of the FrameNet
project, which we hope will make it easier to understand the mixture of
semantic and syntactic information contained in FrameNet annotation.  We show
how English FrameNet and other Frame Semantic resources can be represented as
sets of interconnected graphs of frames, frame elements, semantic types, and
annotated instances of them in text.  We display examples of the new graphical
representation based on the annotations, which combine Frame Semantics and
Construction Grammar, thus capturing most of the syntax and semantics of each
sentence.  We consider how graph theory could help researchers to make better
use of FrameNet data for tasks such as automatic Frame Semantic role labeling,
paraphrasing, and translation.              Finally, we describe the development of
FrameNet-like lexical resources for other languages in the current Multilingual
FrameNet project.  which seeks to discover cross-lingual alignments, both in
the lexicon (for frames and lexical units within frames) and across parallel or
comparable texts.  We conclude with an example showing graphically the semantic
and syntactic similarities and differences between parallel sentences in
English and Japanese.  We will release software for displaying such graphs from
the current data releases.
