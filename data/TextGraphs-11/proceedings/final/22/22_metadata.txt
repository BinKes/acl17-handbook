Abstract#==#Derivational nouns are widely used in Sanskrit corpora and represent an
important cornerstone of productivity in the language. Currently there exists
no analyser that identifies the derivational nouns. We propose a semi
supervised approach for identification of derivational nouns in Sanskrit. We
not only identify the derivational words, but also link them to their
corresponding source words. Our novelty comes in the design of the network
structure for the task. The edge weights are featurised based on the phonetic,
morphological, syntactic and the semantic similarity shared between the words
to be identified. We find that our model is effective for the task, even when
we employ a labelled dataset which is only 5 \% to that of the entire dataset.
