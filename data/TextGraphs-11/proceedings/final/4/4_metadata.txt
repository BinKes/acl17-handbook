Abstract#==#Coherence is a crucial feature of text because
it is indispensable for conveying its
communication purpose and meaning to
its readers. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised text coherence scoring based
on graph construction in which edges are
established between semantically similar
sentences represented by vertices. The
sentence similarity is calculated based on
the cosine similarity of semantic vectors
representing sentences. We provide three
graph construction methods establishing
an edge from a given vertex to a preceding
adjacent vertex, to a single similar
vertex, or to multiple similar vertices.
We evaluated our methods in the document
discrimination task and the insertion
task by comparing our proposed methods
to the supervised (Entity Grid) and unsupervised
(Entity Graph) baselines. In the
document discrimination task, our method
outperformed the unsupervised baseline
but could not do the supervised baseline,
while in the insertion task, our method outperformed
both baselines.
