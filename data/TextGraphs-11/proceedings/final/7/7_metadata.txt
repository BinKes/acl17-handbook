Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel method for multimodal word embedding, which
exploit a generalized framework of multi-view spectral graph embedding to take
into account visual appearances or scenes denoted by words in a corpus.  
We evaluated our method through word similarity tasks and
a concept-to-image search task, having found that it provides word
representations that reflect visual information, while somewhat trading-off the
performance on the word similarity tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our
method captures multimodal linguistic regularities, which enable recovering
relational similarities between words and images by vector arithmetics.
