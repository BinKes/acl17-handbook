Abstract#==#Word embeddings are high-dimensional vector representations of words and are
thus difficult to interpret. In order to deal with this, we introduce an
unsupervised parameter free method for creating a hierarchical graphical
clustering of the full ensemble of word vectors and show that this structure is
a geometrically meaningful representation of the original relations between the
words. This newly obtained representation can be used for better understanding
and thus improving the embedding algorithm and exhibits semantic meaning,
so it can also be utilized in a variety of language processing tasks like
categorization or measuring similarity.
