Abstract#==#In this work, we aim at developing an extractive summarizer in the
multi-document setting. We implement a rank based sentence selection using
continuous vector representations along with key-phrases. Furthermore, we
propose a model to tackle summary coherence for increasing readability.  We
conduct experiments on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004
datasets using ROUGE toolkit. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods
bring significant improvements over the state of the art methods in terms of
informativity and coherence.
