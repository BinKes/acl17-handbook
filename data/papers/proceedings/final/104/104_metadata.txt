Abstract#==#Integrating text and knowledge into a unified semantic space has attracted
significant research interests recently. However, the ambiguity in the common
space remains a challenge, namely that the same mention phrase usually refers
to various entities. In this paper, to deal with the ambiguity of entity
mentions, we propose a novel Multi-Prototype Mention Embedding model, which
learns multiple sense embeddings for each mention by jointly modeling words
from textual contexts and entities derived from a knowledge base. In addition,
we further design an efficient language model based approach to disambiguate
each mention to a specific sense. In experiments, both qualitative and
quantitative analysis demonstrate the high quality of the word, entity and
multi-prototype mention embeddings. Using entity linking as a study case, we
apply our disambiguation method as well as the multi-prototype mention
embeddings on the benchmark dataset, and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
