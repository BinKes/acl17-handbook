Abstract#==#We present a neural model for morphological inflection generation which employs
a hard attention mechanism, inspired by the nearly-monotonic alignment commonly
found between the characters in a word and the characters in its inflection. We
evaluate the model on three previously studied morphological inflection
generation datasets and show that it provides state of the art results in
various setups compared to previous neural and non-neural approaches. Finally
we present an analysis of the continuous representations learned by both the
hard and soft (Bahdanau, 2014) attention models for the task, shedding some
light on the features such models extract.
