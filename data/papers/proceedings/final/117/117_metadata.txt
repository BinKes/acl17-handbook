Abstract#==#Relation detection is a core component of many NLP applications including
Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical recurrent neural network enhanced by residual learning which
detects KB relations given an input question. Our method uses deep residual
bidirectional LSTMs to compare questions and relation names via different
levels of abstraction. Additionally, we propose a simple KBQA system that
integrates entity linking and our proposed relation detector to make the two
components enhance each other. Our experimental results show that our approach
not only achieves outstanding relation detection performance, but more
importantly, it helps our KBQA system achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for
both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA
benchmarks.
