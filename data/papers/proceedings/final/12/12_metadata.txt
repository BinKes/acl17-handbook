Abstract#==#Extracting time expressions from free text is a fundamental task for many
applications. We analyze the time expressions from four datasets and find that
only a small group of words are used to express time information, and the words
in time expressions demonstrate similar syntactic behaviour. Based on the
findings, we propose a type-based approach, named SynTime, to recognize time
expressions. Specifically, we define three main syntactic token types, namely
time token, modifier, and numeral, to group time-related regular expressions
over tokens. On the types we design general heuristic rules to
recognize time expressions. In recognition, SynTime first identifies the time
tokens from raw text, then searches their surroundings for modifiers and
numerals to form time segments, and finally merges the time segments to time
expressions. As a light-weight rule-based tagger, SynTime runs in real time,
and can be easily expanded by simply adding keywords for the text of different
types and of different domains. Experiment on benchmark datasets and tweets
data shows that SynTime outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
