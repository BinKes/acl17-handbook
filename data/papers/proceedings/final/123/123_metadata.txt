Abstract#==#We examine differences in portrayal of characters in movies using
psycholinguistic and graph theoretic measures computed directly from
screenplays. Differences are examined with respect to characters' gender, race,
age and other metadata. Psycholinguistic metrics are extrapolated to dialogues
in movies using a linear regression model built on a set of manually annotated
seed words. Interesting patterns are revealed about relationships between
genders of production team and the gender ratio of characters. Several
correlations are noted between gender, race, age of characters and the
linguistic metrics.
