Abstract#==#The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional
LSTMs to encode the source sentence. We present a faster and simpler
architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. This allows to
encode the source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for
which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. On WMT'16
English-Romanian translation we achieve competitive accuracy to the
state-of-the-art and on WMT'15 English-German we outperform several recently
published results. Our models obtain almost the same accuracy as a very deep
LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation. We speed up CPU decoding by
more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional
LSTM.
