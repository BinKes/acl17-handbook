Abstract#==#Word embeddings are well known to capture linguistic regularities of the
language on which they are trained. Researchers also observe that these
regularities can transfer across languages. However, previous endeavors to
connect separate monolingual word embeddings typically require cross-lingual
signals as supervision, either in the form of parallel corpus or seed lexicon.
In this work, we show that such cross-lingual connection can actually be
established without any form of supervision. We achieve this end by formulating
the problem as a natural adversarial game, and investigating techniques that
are crucial to successful training. We carry out evaluation on the unsupervised
bilingual lexicon induction task. Even though this task appears intrinsically
cross-lingual, we are able to demonstrate encouraging performance without any
cross-lingual clues.
