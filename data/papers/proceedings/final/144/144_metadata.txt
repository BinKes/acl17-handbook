Abstract#==#We model a dependency graph as a book, a particular kind of topological space,
for
semantic dependency parsing. The spine of the book is made up of a sequence of
words, and each page contains a subset of noncrossing arcs. To build a semantic
graph for a given sentence, we design new Maximum Subgraph algorithms to
generate noncrossing graphs on each page, and a Lagrangian Relaxation-based
algorithm tocombine pages into a book. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the bookembedding framework across a wide range of conditions.
Our parser obtains
comparable results with a state-of-the-art
transition-based parser.
