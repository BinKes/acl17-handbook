Abstract#==#Knowing the quality of reading comprehension (RC) datasets is important for the
development of natural-language understanding systems.
  In this study, two classes of metrics were adopted for evaluating RC
datasets: prerequisite skills and readability. We applied these classes to six
existing datasets, including MCTest and SQuAD, and highlighted the
characteristics of the datasets according to each metric and the correlation
between the two classes.
  Our dataset analysis suggests that the readability of RC datasets does not
directly affect the question difficulty and that it is possible to create an RC
dataset that is easy to read but difficult to answer.
