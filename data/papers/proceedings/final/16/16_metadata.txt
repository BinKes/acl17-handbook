Abstract#==#This paper tackles the task of event detection (ED), which involves identifying
and categorizing events. We argue that arguments provide significant clues to
this task, but they are either completely ignored or exploited in an indirect
manner in existing detection approaches. In this work, we propose to exploit
argument information explicitly for ED via supervised attention mechanisms. In
specific, we systematically investigate the proposed model under the
supervision of different attention strategies. Experimental results show that
our approach advances state-of-the-arts and achieves the best F1 score on
ACE 2005 dataset.
