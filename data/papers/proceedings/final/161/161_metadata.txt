Abstract#==#Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have provably enhanced the
state-of-the-art Neural  Machine Translation (NMT) with
 its capability in modeling complex functions and capturing
  complex linguistic structures.
  However NMT with deep architecture in its encoder or
  decoder RNNs often suffer from severe gradient diffusion
  due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often
  makes the optimization much more difficult.
   To address this problem we propose a novel linear
   associative units (LAU)  to reduce the gradient
    propagation path inside the recurrent unit.
    Different from conventional
    approaches (LSTM unit and GRU),
   LAUs uses linear associative connections
   between input and
   output of the recurrent unit,
   which allows unimpeded information flow through both
    space and time  The model is quite simple,
     but it is surprisingly effective. Our empirical
     study on Chinese-English translation shows that our
     model with proper configuration can improve
      by 11.7 BLEU upon Groundhog and the best
      reported on results in the same setting.
      On WMT14 English-German task and a larger WMT14
       English-French task, our
 model achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art.
