Abstract#==#We study automatic question generation for sentences from text passages in
reading comprehension. We introduce an attention-based sequence learning model
for the task and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs.
paragraph-level information. In contrast to all previous work, our model does
not rely on hand-crafted rules or a sophisticated NLP pipeline;  it is instead
trainable end-to-end via sequence-to-sequence learning. Automatic evaluation
results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
rule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system are
also rated as being more natural (\ie, grammaticality, fluency) and as more
difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from the
original text and reasoning needed to answer).
