Abstract#==#Until now, error type performance for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)
systems could only be measured in terms of recall because system output is not
annotated. To overcome this problem, we introduce ERRANT, a grammatical ERRor
ANnotation Toolkit designed to automatically extract edits from parallel
original and corrected sentences and classify them according to a new,
dataset-agnostic, rule-based framework. This not only facilitates error type
evaluation at different levels of granularity, but can also be used to reduce
annotator workload and standardise existing GEC datasets. Human experts rated
the automatic edits as ``Good'' or ``Acceptable'' in at least 95\% of cases, so
we applied ERRANT to the system output of the CoNLL-2014 shared task to carry
out a detailed error type analysis for the first time.
