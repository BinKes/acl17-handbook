Abstract#==#Previous studies on Chinese semantic role labeling (SRL) have concentrated on a
single semantically annotated corpus. But the training data of single corpus is
often limited. Whereas the other existing semantically annotated corpora for
Chinese SRL are scattered across different annotation frameworks. But still,
Data sparsity remains a bottleneck. This situation calls for larger training
datasets, or effective approaches which can take advantage of highly
heterogeneous data. In this paper, we focus mainly on the latter, that is, to
improve Chinese SRL by using heterogeneous corpora together. We propose a novel
progressive learning model which augments the Progressive Neural Network with
Gated Recurrent Adapters. The model can accommodate heterogeneous inputs and
effectively transfer knowledge between them. We also release a new corpus,
Chinese SemBank, for Chinese SRL. Experiments on CPB 1.0 show that our model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
