Abstract#==#Word embeddings have become widely-used in document analysis. While a large
number of models for mapping words to vector spaces have been developed, it
remains undetermined how much net gain can be achieved over traditional
approaches based on bag-of-words. In this paper, we propose a new document
clustering approach by combining any word embedding with a state-of-the-art
algorithm for clustering empirical distributions. By using the Wasserstein
distance between distributions, the word-to-word semantic relationship is taken
into account in a principled way. The new clustering method is easy to use and
consistently outperforms other methods on a variety of data sets. More
importantly, the method provides an effective framework for determining when
and how much word embeddings contribute to document analysis. Experimental
results with multiple embedding models are reported.
