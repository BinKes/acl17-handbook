Abstract#==#Cloze-style reading comprehension is a representative problem in mining
relationship between document and query.
In this paper, we present a simple but novel model called
attention-over-attention reader for better solving cloze-style reading
comprehension task.
The proposed model aims to place another attention mechanism over the
document-level attention and induces ``attended attention'' for final answer
predictions.
One advantage of our model is that it is simpler than related works while
giving excellent performance.
In addition to the primary model, we also propose an N-best re-ranking strategy
to double check the validity of the candidates and further improve the
performance.
Experimental results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform
various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin in public datasets, such as
CNN and Children's Book Test.
