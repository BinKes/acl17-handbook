Abstract#==#Recently emerged intelligent assistants on smartphones and home electronics
(e.g., Siri and Alexa) can be seen as novel hybrids of domain-specific
task-oriented spoken dialogue systems and open-domain non-task-oriented ones.
To realize such hybrid dialogue systems, this paper investigates determining
whether or not a user is going to have a chat with the system. To address the
lack of benchmark datasets for this task, we construct a new dataset consisting
of 15,160 utterances collected from the real log data of a commercial
intelligent assistant (and will release the dataset to facilitate future
research activity). In addition, we investigate using tweets and Web search
queries for handling open-domain user utterances, which characterize the task
of chat detection. Experimental experiments demonstrated that, while simple
supervised methods are effective, the use of the tweets and search queries
further improves the F$_1$-score from 86.21 to 87.53.
