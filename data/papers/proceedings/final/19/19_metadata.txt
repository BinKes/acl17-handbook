Abstract#==#Most existing approaches for zero pronoun resolution are heavily relying on
annotated data, which is often released by shared task organizers.
Therefore, the lack of annotated data becomes a major obstacle in the progress
of zero pronoun resolution task. 
Also, it is expensive to spend manpower on labeling the data for better
performance.
To alleviate the problem above, in this paper, we propose a simple but novel
approach to automatically generate large-scale pseudo training data for zero
pronoun resolution.
Furthermore, we successfully transfer the cloze-style reading comprehension
neural network model into zero pronoun resolution task and propose a two-step
training mechanism to overcome the gap between the pseudo training data and the
real one.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art systems with an absolute improvements of 3.1\% F-score on
OntoNotes 5.0 data.
