Abstract#==#We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable
framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological
work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing
techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures),
discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex
semantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is
not supported by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a
novel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not
just for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can
inform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in
languages that frequently use discontinuous structures.
