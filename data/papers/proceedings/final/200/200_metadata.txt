Abstract#==#Generating answer with natural language sentence is very important in
real-world question answering systems, which needs to obtain a right answer as
well as a coherent natural response. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
question answering system called COREQA in sequence-to-sequence learning, which
incorporates copying and retrieving mechanisms to generate natural answers
within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, in COREQA, the semantic
units (words, phrases and entities) in a natural answer are dynamically
predicted from the vocabulary, copied from the given question and/or retrieved
from the corresponding knowledge base jointly. Our empirical study on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates the efficiency of COREQA, which
is able to generate correct, coherent and natural answers for knowledge
inquired questions.
