Abstract#==#Finding the correct hypernyms for entities is essential for taxonomy learning,
fine-grained entity categorization, query understanding, etc. Due to the
flexibility of the Chinese language, it is challenging to identify hypernyms
in Chinese accurately. Rather than extracting hypernyms from texts, in this
paper, we present a transductive learning approach to establish mappings from
entities to hypernyms in the embedding space directly. It combines linear and
non-linear embedding projection models, with the capacity of
encoding arbitrary language-specific rules. Experiments on real-world datasets
illustrate that our approach outperforms previous methods for Chinese hypernym
prediction.
