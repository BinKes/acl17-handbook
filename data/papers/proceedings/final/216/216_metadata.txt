Abstract#==#This paper presents an LDA-based model that generates topically coherent
segments within documents by jointly segmenting documents and assigning topics
to their words. The coherence between topics is ensured through a copula,
binding the topics associated to the words of a segment. In addition, this
model relies on both document and segment specific topic distributions so as to
capture fine grained differences in topic assignments. We show that the
proposed model naturally encompasses other state-of-the-art LDA-based models
designed for similar tasks. Furthermore, our experiments, conducted on six
different publicly available datasets, show the effectiveness of our model in
terms of perplexity, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information, which captures
the coherence between the generated topics, and the Micro F1 measure for text
classification.
