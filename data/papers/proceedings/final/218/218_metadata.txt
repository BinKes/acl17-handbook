Abstract#==#What prerequisite knowledge should students achieve a level of mastery before
moving forward to learn subsequent coursewares? We study the extent to which
the prerequisite relation between knowledge concepts in Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) can be inferred automatically. In particular, what kinds of
information can be leverage to uncover the potential prerequisite relation
between knowledge concepts. We first propose a representation learning-based
method for learning latent representations of course concepts, and then
investigate how different features capture the prerequisite relations between
concepts. Our experiments on three datasets form Coursera show that the
proposed method achieves significant improvements (+5.9-48.0% by F1-score)
comparing with existing methods.
