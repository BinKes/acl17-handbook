Abstract#==#We introduce a neural semantic parser which is interpretable and scalable. Our
model converts natural language utterances to intermediate, domain-general
natural language representations in the form of predicate-argument structures,
which are induced with a transition system and subsequently mapped to target
domains. The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated logical
forms or their denotations. We achieve the state of the art on SPADES and
GRAPHQUESTIONS and obtain competitive results on GEOQUERY and WEBQUESTIONS. The
induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of
representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are dif- ferent from
linguistically motivated ones.
