Abstract#==#Named entities are frequently used in a metonymic manner. They serve as
references to related entities such as people and organisations. Accurate
identification and interpretation of metonymy can be directly beneficial to
various NLP applications, such as Named Entity Recognition and Geographical
Parsing. Until now, metonymy resolution (MR) methods mainly relied on parsers,
taggers, dictionaries, external word lists and other handcrafted lexical
resources. We show how a minimalist neural approach combined with a novel
predicate window method can achieve competitive results on the SemEval 2007
task on Metonymy Resolution. Additionally, we contribute with a new
Wikipedia-based MR dataset called RelocaR, which is tailored towards locations
as well as improving previous deficiencies in annotation guidelines.
