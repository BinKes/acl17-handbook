Abstract#==#Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in information
extraction. To tackle this problem, we firstly propose a novel tagging scheme
that can convert the joint extraction task to a tagging problem.. Then, based
on our tagging scheme, we study different end-to-end models to extract entities
and their relations directly, without identifying entities and relations
separately. We conduct experiments on a public dataset produced by distant
supervision method and the experimental results show that the tagging based
methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning
methods. Whatâ€™s more, the end-to-end model proposed in this paper, achieves
the best results on the public dataset.
