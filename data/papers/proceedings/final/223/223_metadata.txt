Abstract#==#Opinionated Natural Language Generation (ONLG) is a new, challenging, task that
aims to automatically generate human-like, subjective, responses to opinionated
articles online. 

We present a data-driven architecture for ONLG that generates subjective
responses triggered by users’ agendas, consisting of topics and sentiments,
and based on wide-coverage automatically-acquired generative grammars.
We compare three types of grammatical representations that we design for ONLG,
which interleave different layers of linguistic information and are induced
from a new, enriched dataset we developed.

Our evaluation shows that generation with Relational-Realizational (Tsarfaty
and Sima’an, 2008) inspired grammar gets better language model scores than
lexicalized grammars `a la Collins (2003), and that the latter gets better
human-evaluation scores. 

We also show that conditioning the generation on topic models makes generated
responses more relevant to the document content.
