Abstract#==#The paper presents a procedure of building an evaluation dataset. for the
validation of compositional distributional semantics models estimated for
languages other than English. The procedure generally builds on steps designed
to assemble the SICK corpus, which contains pairs of English sentences
annotated for semantic relatedness and entailment, because we aim at building a
comparable dataset. However, the implementation of particular building steps
significantly differs from the original SICK design assumptions, which is
caused by both lack of necessary extraneous resources for an investigated
language and the need for language-specific transformation rules. The designed
procedure is verified on Polish, a fusional language with a relatively free
word order, and contributes to building a Polish evaluation dataset. The
resource consists of 10K sentence pairs which are human-annotated for semantic
relatedness and entailment. The dataset may be used for the evaluation of
compositional distributional semantics models of Polish.
