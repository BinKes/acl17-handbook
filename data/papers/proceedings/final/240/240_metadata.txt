Abstract#==#Most work on segmenting text does so on the basis of topic changes,
but it can be of interest to segment by other, stylistically expressed
characteristics such as change of authorship or native language.  We
propose a Bayesian unsupervised text segmentation approach to the
latter.  While baseline models achieve essentially random segmentation
on our task, indicating its difficulty, a Bayesian model that
incorporates appropriately compact language models and alternating
asymmetric priors can achieve scores on the standard metrics around
halfway to perfect segmentation.
