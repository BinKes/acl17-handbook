Abstract#==#In recent years word-embedding models have gained great popularity due to their
remarkable performance on several tasks, including word analogy questions and
caption generation. An unexpected "side-effect" of such models is that their
vectors often exhibit compositionality, i.e., \emph{adding} two word-vectors
results in a vector that is only a small angle away from the vector of a word
representing the semantic composite of the original words, e.g., "man" +
"royal" = "king".

This work provides a theoretical justification for the presence of additive
compositionality in word vectors learned using the Skip-Gram model. In
particular, it shows that additive compositionality holds in an even stricter
sense (small distance rather than small angle) under certain assumptions on the
process generating the corpus. As a corollary, it explains the success of
vector calculus in solving word analogies. When these assumptions do not hold,
this work describes the correct non-linear composition operator. 

Finally, this work establishes a connection between the Skip-Gram model and the
Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction (SDR) framework of Globerson and Tishby:
the parameters of SDR models can be obtained from those of Skip-Gram models
simply by adding information on symbol frequencies. This shows that Skip-Gram
embeddings are optimal in the sense of Globerson and Tishby and, further,
implies that the heuristics commonly used to approximately fit Skip-Gram models
can be used to fit SDR models.
