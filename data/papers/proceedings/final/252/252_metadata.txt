Abstract#==#Grammatical error correction (GEC) systems strive to correct both global errors
inword order and usage, and local errors inspelling and inflection. Further
developing upon recent work on neural machine translation, we propose a new
hybrid neural model with nested attention layers for GEC.Experiments show that
the new model can effectively correct errors of both types by incorporating
word and character-level information, and that the model significantly
outperforms previous  neural models for GEC as measured on the standard
CoNLL-14 benchmark dataset.Further analysis also shows that the superiority of
the proposed model can be largely attributed to the use of the nested attention
mechanism, which has proven particularly effective incorrecting local errors
that involve small edits in orthography.
