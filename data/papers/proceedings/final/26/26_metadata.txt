Abstract#==#With the rapid growth of knowledge bases (KBs) on the web, how to take full
advantage of them becomes increasingly important. Question answering over
knowledge base (KB-QA) is one of the  promising approaches to access the
substantial knowledge. Meanwhile, as the neural network-based (NN-based)
methods develop, NN-based KB-QA has already achieved impressive results.
However, previous work did not put more emphasis on question representation,
and the question is converted into a fixed vector regardless of its candidate
answers. This simple representation strategy is not easy to express the proper
information in the question. Hence, we present an end-to-end neural network
model to represent the questions and their corresponding scores dynamically
according to the various candidate answer aspects via cross-attention
mechanism. In addition, we leverage the global knowledge inside the underlying
KB, aiming at integrating the rich KB information into the representation of
the answers. As a result, it could alleviates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
problem, which helps the cross-attention model to represent the question more
precisely. The experimental results on WebQuestions demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.
