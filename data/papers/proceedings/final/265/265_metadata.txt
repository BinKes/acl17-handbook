Abstract#==#Language models are typically applied at the sentence level, without
  access to the broader document context.  We present a neural language
  model that incorporates document context in the form of a topic
  model-like architecture, thus providing a succinct representation of the
  broader document context outside of the current sentence.  Experiments
  over a range of datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms a pure
  sentence-based model in terms of language model perplexity, and leads
  to topics that are potentially more coherent than those produced by a
  standard LDA topic model.  Our model also has the ability to generate
  related sentences for a topic, providing another way to interpret topics.
