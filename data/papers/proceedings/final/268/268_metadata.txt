Abstract#==#In this paper, we study a novel approach for named entity recognition (NER) and
mention detection (MD) in natural language processing. Instead of treating NER
as a sequence labeling problem, we propose a new local detection approach,
which relies on the recent fixed-size ordinally forgetting encoding (FOFE)
method to fully encode each sentence fragment and its left/right contexts into
a fixed-size representation. Subsequently, a simple feedforward neural network
(FFNN) is learned to either reject or predict entity label for each individual
text fragment. The proposed method has been evaluated in several popular NER
and MD tasks, including CoNLL 2003 NER task and  TAC-KBP2015 and TAC-KBP2016
Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (EDL) tasks. Our method has yielded
pretty strong performance in all of these examined tasks. This local detection
approach has shown many advantages over the traditional sequence labeling
methods.
