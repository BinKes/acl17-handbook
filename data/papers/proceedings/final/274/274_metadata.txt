Abstract#==#Aspect extraction is an important and challenging task in aspect-based
sentiment analysis. Existing works tend to apply variants of topic models on
this task. While fairly successful, these methods usually do not produce highly
coherent aspects. In this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the
aim of discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by exploiting
the distribution of word co-occurrences through the use of neural word
embeddings. Unlike topic models which typically assume independently generated
words, word embedding models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to
be located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition, we use an
attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words during training, further
improving the coherence of aspects. Experimental results on real-life datasets
demonstrate that our approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects,
and substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation tasks.
