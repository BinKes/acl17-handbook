Abstract#==#We propose a sequence labeling framework with a secondary training objective,
learning to predict surrounding words for every word in the dataset.
This language modeling objective incentivises the system to learn
general-purpose patterns of semantic and syntactic composition, which are also
useful for improving accuracy on different sequence labeling tasks.
The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of
error detection in learner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and
POS-tagging.
The novel language modeling objective provided consistent performance
improvements on every benchmark, without requiring any additional annotated or
unannotated data.
