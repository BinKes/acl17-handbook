Abstract#==#We study the Maximum Subgraph problem in deep dependency parsing. We consider
two restrictions to deep dependency graphs: (a) 1-endpoint-crossing and (b)
pagenumber-2. Our main contribution is an exact algorithm that ob-
tains maximum subgraphs satisfying both restrictions simultaneously in time
O(n5).
Moreover, ignoring one linguistically-rare structure descreases the complexity
to
O(n4). We
also extend our quartic-time algorithm into
a practical parser with a discriminative disambiguation model and evaluate its
performance on four linguistic data sets used in
semantic dependency parsing.
