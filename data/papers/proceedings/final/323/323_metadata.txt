Abstract#==#We propose a local coherence model based on a convolutional neural network that
operates over the entity grid representation of a text. The model captures long
range en- tity transitions along with entity-specific features without loosing
generalization, thanks to the power of distributed representation. We present a
pairwise ranking method to train the model in an end-to-end fashion on a task
and learn task-specific high level features. Our evaluation on three different
coherence assessment tasks demonstrates that our model achieves state of the
art results outperforming existing models by a good margin.
