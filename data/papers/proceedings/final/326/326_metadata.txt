Abstract#==#Different linguistic perspectives causes many diverse segmentation criteria for
Chinese word segmentation (CWS). Most existing methods focus on improve the
performance for each single criterion. However, it is interesting to exploit
these different criteria and mining their common underlying knowledge. In this
paper, we propose adversarial multi-criteria learning for CWS by integrating
shared knowledge from multiple heterogeneous segmentation criteria. 
Experiments on eight corpora with heterogeneous segmentation criteria show that
the performance of each corpus obtains a significant improvement, compared to
single-criterion learning. Source codes of this paper are available on Github.
