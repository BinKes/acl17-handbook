Abstract#==#This paper deals with sentence-level sentiment classification. Though a variety
of neural network models have been proposed recently, however, previous models
either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, most of which has
remarkably degraded performance when trained with only sentence-level
annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment
lexicons, negation words, intensity words). In this paper, we propose simple
models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to model the
linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words.
Results show that our models are able to capture the linguistic role of
sentiment words, negation words, and intensity words in sentiment expression.
