Abstract#==#In this paper, we present the gated self-matching networks for reading
comprehension style question answering, which aims to answer questions from a
given passage. We first match the question and passage with gated
attention-based recurrent networks to obtain the question-aware passage
representation. Then we propose a self-matching attention mechanism to refine
the representation by matching the passage against itself, which effectively
encodes information from the whole passage. We finally employ the pointer
networks to locate the positions of answers from the passages. We conduct
extensive experiments on the SQuAD dataset. The single model achieves 71.3% on
the evaluation metrics of exact match on the hidden test set, while the
ensemble model further boosts the results to 75.9%. At the time of submission
of the paper, our model holds the first place on the SQuAD leaderboard for both
single and ensemble model.
