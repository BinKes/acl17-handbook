Abstract#==#We present neural network-based joint models for Chinese word segmentation, POS
tagging and dependency parsing. Our models are the first neural approaches for
fully joint Chinese analysis that is known to prevent the error propagation
problem of pipeline models. Although word embeddings play a key role in
dependency parsing, they cannot be applied directly to the joint task in the
previous work. To address this problem, we propose embeddings of character
strings, in addition to words. Experiments show that our models outperform
existing systems in Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging, and perform
preferable accuracies in dependency parsing. We also explore bi-LSTM models
with fewer features.
