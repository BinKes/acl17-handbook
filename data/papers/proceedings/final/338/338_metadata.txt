Abstract#==#Solving cold-start problem in review spam detection is an urgent and
significant task.
It can help the on-line review websites to relieve the damage of spammers in
time, but has never been investigated by previous work.
This paper proposes a novel neural network model to detect review spam for
cold-start problem, by learning to represent the new reviewers' review with
jointly embedded textual and behavioral information.
Experimental results prove the proposed model achieves an effective performance
and possesses preferable domain-adaptability.
It is also applicable to a large scale dataset in an unsupervised way.
