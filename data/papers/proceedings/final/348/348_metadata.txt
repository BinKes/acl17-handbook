Abstract#==#Relation extraction has been widely used for finding unknown relational facts
from plain text. Most existing methods focus on exploiting mono-lingual data
for relation extraction, ignoring massive information from the texts in various
languages. To address this issue, we introduce a multi-lingual neural relation
extraction framework, which employs mono-lingual attention to utilize the
information within mono-lingual texts and further proposes cross-lingual
attention to consider the information consistency and complementarity among
cross-lingual texts. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our
model can take advantage of multi-lingual texts and consistently achieve
significant improvements on relation extraction as compared with baselines.
