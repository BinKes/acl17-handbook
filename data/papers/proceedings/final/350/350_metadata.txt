Abstract#==#Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised
learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training
data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in
size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for
knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to
automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and
linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each
event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The
experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically
labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our
automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then
improve the performance of models learned from these data.
