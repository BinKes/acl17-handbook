Abstract#==#The performance of Japanese predicate argument structure (PAS) analysis has
improved in recent years thanks to the joint modeling of interactions between
multiple predicates. However, this approach relies heavily on syntactic
information predicted by parsers, and suffers from errorpropagation. To remedy
this problem, we
introduce a model that uses grid-type recurrent neural networks. The proposed
model automatically induces features sensitive to multi-predicate interactions
from
the word sequence information of a sentence. Experiments on the NAIST Text
Corpus demonstrate that without syntactic information, our model outperforms
previous syntax-dependent models.
