Abstract#==#Discourse modes play an important role in writing composition and evaluation.
This paper presents a study on the manual and automatic identification of
narration,exposition, description, argument and emotion expressing sentences in
narrative essays. We annotate a corpus to study the characteristics of
discourse modes
and describe a neural sequence labeling model for identification. Evaluation
results show that discourse modes can be identified automatically with an
average F1-score of 0.7. We further demonstrate that discourse modes can be
used as features that improve automatic essay scoring (AES). The impacts of
discourse modes for AES are also discussed.
