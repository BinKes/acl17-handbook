Abstract#==#Network embedding (NE) is playing a critical role in network analysis, due to
its ability to represent vertices with efficient low-dimensional embedding
vectors. However, existing NE models aim to learn a fixed context-free
embedding for each vertex and neglect the diverse roles when interacting with
other vertices. In this paper, we assume that one vertex usually shows
different aspects when interacting with different neighbor vertices, and should
own different embeddings respectively. Therefore, we present Context-Aware
Network Embedding (CANE), a novel NE model to address this issue. CANE learns
context-aware embeddings for vertices with mutual attention mechanism and is
expected to model the semantic relationships between vertices more precisely.
In experiments, we compare our model with existing NE models on three
real-world datasets. Experimental results show that CANE achieves significant
improvement than state-of-the-art methods on link prediction and comparable
performance on vertex classification. The source code and datasets can be
