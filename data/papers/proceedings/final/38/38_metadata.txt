Abstract#==#Nowadays a typical Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model generates
translations from left to right as a linear sequence, during which latent
syntactic structures of the target sentences are not explicitly concerned.
Inspired by the success of using syntactic knowledge of target language for
improving statistical machine translation,
in this paper we propose a novel Sequence-to-Dependency Neural Machine
Translation (SD-NMT) method, in which the target word sequence and its
corresponding dependency structure are jointly constructed and modeled, and
this structure is used as context to facilitate word generations. Experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on Chinese-English and Japanese-English translation
tasks.
