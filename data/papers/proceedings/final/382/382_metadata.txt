Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel framework for semi-automatically
creating linguistically challenging micro-planning data-to-text
corpora from existing Knowledge Bases. Because our method pairs data
of varying size and shape with texts ranging from simple clauses to
short texts, a dataset created using this framework provides a
challenging benchmark for microplanning. Another feature of this
framework is that it can be applied to any large scale knowledge base
and can therefore be used to train and learn KB verbalisers.  We apply
our framework to DBpedia data and compare the resulting dataset with
Wen et al. 2016's. We show that while Wen et al.'s dataset is
more than twice larger than ours, it is less diverse both in terms of
input and in terms of text. We thus propose our corpus generation
framework as a novel method for creating challenging data sets from
which NLG models can be learned which are capable of handling the
complex interactions occurring during in micro-planning between
lexicalisation, aggregation, surface realisation, referring expression
generation and sentence segmentation. To encourage researchers to take
up this challenge, we made available a dataset of 21,855 data/text
pairs created using this framework in the context of the
WebNLG shared task.
