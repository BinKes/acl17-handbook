Abstract#==#We present a method for populating fine-grained classes (e.g., “1950s
American jazz musicians”) with instances (e.g., Charles Mingus ). While
state-of-the-art methods tend to treat class labels as single lexical units,
the proposed method considers each of the individual modifiers in the class
label relative to the head. An evaluation on the task of reconstructing
Wikipedia category pages demonstrates a >10 point increase in AUC, over a
strong baseline relying on widely-used Hearst patterns.
