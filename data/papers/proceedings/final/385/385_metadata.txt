Abstract#==#A fundamental question in language learning concerns the role of a speaker's
first language in second language acquisition. We present a novel methodology
for studying this question: analysis of eye-movement patterns in second
language reading of free-form text. Using this methodology, we demonstrate for
the first time that the native language of English learners can be predicted
from their gaze fixations when reading English. We provide analysis of
classifier uncertainty and learned features, which indicates that differences
in English reading are likely to be rooted in linguistic divergences across
native languages. The presented framework complements production studies and
offers new ground for advancing research on multilingualism.
