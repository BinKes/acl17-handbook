Abstract#==#Cognitive NLP systems- i.e., NLP systems that make use of behavioral data -
augment traditional text-based features with cognitive features extracted from
eye-movement patterns, EEG signals, brain-imaging etc. Such extraction of
features is typically manual. We contend that manual extraction of features may
not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail
in complex classification tasks like Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection,
and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the
learning system.  We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive
features from the eye-movement/gaze data of human readers reading the text and
use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment
polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and
text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on
published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze
information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and
gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i)  CNN
based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely
on handcrafted gaze and textual features.
