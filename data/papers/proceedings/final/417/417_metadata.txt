Abstract#==#Understanding how ideas relate to each other is a fundamental question in many
domains, ranging from intellectual history to public communication. Because
ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework to
systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their
occurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are
represented. Combining two statistics—cooccurrence within documents and
prevalence correlation over time—our approach reveals a number of different
ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can
closely track each other’s prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur,
almost like a “cold war” scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence
and prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further
demonstrate that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between
ideas through in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.
