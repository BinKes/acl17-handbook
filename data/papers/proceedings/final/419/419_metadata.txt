Abstract#==#We present a novel cross-lingual transfer method for paradigm completion, the
task of mapping a lemma to its inflected forms, using a neural encoder-decoder
model, the state of the art for the monolingual task. We use labeled data from
a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In
experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we
obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even
zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible. We further find that the degree
of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer
morphological knowledge.
