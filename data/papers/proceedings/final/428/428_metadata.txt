Abstract#==#We present a  new supervised framework that learns to estimate automatic
Pyramid scores and uses them for optimization-based extractive multi-document
summarization. For learning automatic Pyramid scores, we developed a method for
automatic training data generation which is based on a genetic algorithm using
automatic Pyramid as the fitness function. Our experimental evaluation shows
that  our new framework significantly outperforms strong baselines regarding
automatic Pyramid, and that there is much room for improvement in comparison
with the upper-bound for automatic Pyramid.
