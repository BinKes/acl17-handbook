Abstract#==#Human verbal communication includes affective messages which are conveyed
through use of emotionally colored words. There has been a lot of research
effort in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural
language models with affective information remains an area ripe for
exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term
Memory) language model for generation of conversational text, conditioned on
affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the
degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design
parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that
Affect-LM can generate naturally looking emotional sentences without
sacrificing grammatical correctness. Affect-LM also learns
affect-discriminative word representations, and perplexity experiments show
that additional affective information in conversational text can improve
language model prediction.
