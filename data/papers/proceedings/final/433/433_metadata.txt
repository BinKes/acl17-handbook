Abstract#==#Singlish can be interesting to the ACL community both linguistically as a major
creole based on English, and computationally for information extraction and
sentiment analysis of regional social media. We investigate dependency parsing
of Singlish by constructing a dependency treebank under the Universal
Dependencies scheme, and then training a neural network model by integrating
English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser trained on the
Singlish treebank. Results show that English knowledge can lead to 25% relative
error reduction, resulting in a parser of 84.47% accuracies. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to use neural stacking to improve cross-lingual
dependency parsing on low-resource languages. We make both our annotation and
parser available for further research.
