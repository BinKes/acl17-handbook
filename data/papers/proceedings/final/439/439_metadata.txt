Abstract#==#We consider the problem of translating high-level textual descriptions to
formal representations in technical documentation as part of an effort to model
the meaning of such documentation.  We focus specifically on the problem of
learning translational correspondences between text descriptions and grounded
representations in the target documentation, such as formal representation of
functions or code templates.  Our approach exploits the parallel nature of such
documentation, or the tight coupling between high-level text and the low-level
representations we aim to learn. Data is collected by mining technical
documents for such parallel text-representation pairs, which we use to train a
simple semantic parsing model. We report new baseline results on sixteen novel
datasets, including the standard library documentation for nine popular
programming languages across seven natural languages, and a small collection of
Unix utility manuals.
