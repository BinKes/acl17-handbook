Abstract#==#We propose a new A* CCG parsing model in which the probability of a tree is
decomposed into factors of CCG categories and its syntactic dependencies both
defined on bi-directional LSTMs. Our factored model allows the precomputation
of all probabilities and runs very efficiently, while modeling sentence
structures explicitly via dependencies. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art
results on English and Japanese CCG parsing.
