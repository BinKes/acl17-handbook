Abstract#==#We show that discourse structure, as defined by Rhetorical Structure Theory and
provided by an existing discourse parser, benefits text categorization.  Our
approach uses a recursive neural network and a newly proposed attention
mechanism to compute a representation of the text that focuses on salient
content, from the perspective of both RST and the task.  Experiments consider
variants of the approach and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.
