Abstract#==#We present a system which parses sentences into Abstract Meaning
Representations, improving state-of-the-art results for this task by more than
5%.  AMR graphs represent semantic content using linguistic properties such
as semantic roles, coreference, negation, and more.  The AMR parser does not
rely on a syntactic pre-parse, or heavily engineered features, and uses five
recurrent neural networks as the key architectural components for inferring AMR
graphs.
