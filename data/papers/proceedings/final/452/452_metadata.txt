Abstract#==#Semantic representation is receiving growing attention in NLP in the past few
years, and many proposals for semantic schemes (e.g., AMR, UCCA, GMB, UDS) have
been put forth. Yet, little has been done to assess the achievements and the
shortcomings of these new contenders, compare them with syntactic schemes, and
clarify the general goals of research on semantic representation. We address
these gaps by critically surveying the state of the art in the field.
