Abstract#==#Volatility prediction—an essential concept in financial markets—has
recently been addressed using sentiment analysis methods. We investigate the
sentiment of annual disclosures of companies in stock markets to forecast
volatility. We specifically explore the use of recent Information Retrieval
(IR) term weighting models that are effectively extended by related terms using
word embeddings. In parallel to textual information, factual market data have
been widely used as the mainstream approach to forecast market risk. We
therefore study different fusion methods to combine text and market data
resources. Our word embedding-based approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate the characteristics of
the reports of the companies in different financial sectors.
