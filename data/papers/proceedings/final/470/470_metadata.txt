Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose an extractive multi-document summarization (MDS)
system using joint optimization and active learning for content selection
grounded in user feedback. Our method interactively obtains user feedback to
gradually improve the results of a state-of-the-art integer linear programming
(ILP) framework for MDS. Our methods complement fully automatic methods in
producing high-quality summaries with a minimum number of iterations and
feedbacks.
We conduct multiple simulation-based experiments and analyze the effect of
feedback-based concept selection in the ILP setup in order to maximize the
user-desired content in the summary.
