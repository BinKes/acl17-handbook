Abstract#==#In this paper, we aim to understand whether current language and vision (LaVi)
models truly grasp the interaction between the two modalities. To this end, we
propose an extension of the MS-COCO dataset, FOIL-COCO, which associates images
with both correct and `foil' captions, that is, descriptions of the image that
are highly similar to the original ones, but contain one single mistake (`foil
word'). We show that current LaVi models fall into the traps of this data and
perform badly on three tasks: a) caption  classification (correct vs. foil); b)
foil word detection; c) foil word correction. Humans, in contrast, have
near-perfect performance on those tasks. We demonstrate that merely utilising
language cues is not enough to model FOIL-COCO and that it challenges the
state-of-the-art by requiring a fine-grained understanding of the relation
between text and image.
