Abstract#==#We investigate object naming, which is an important sub-task of referring
expression generation on real-world images. As opposed to mutually exclusive
labels used in object recognition, object names are more flexible, subject to
communicative preferences and semantically related to each other. Therefore, we
investigate models of referential word meaning that link visual to lexical
information which we assume to be given through distributional word embeddings.

We present a model that learns individual predictors for object names that link
visual and distributional aspects of word meaning during training. We show that
this is particularly beneficial for zero-shot learning, as compared to
projecting visual objects directly into the distributional space. In a standard
object naming task, we find that different ways of combining lexical and visual
information achieve very similar performance, though experiments on model
combination suggest that they capture complementary aspects of referential
meaning.
