Abstract#==#Chunks (or phrases) once played a pivotal role in machine translation. By using
a chunk rather than a word as the basic translation unit, local (intra-chunk)
and global (inter-chunk) word orders and dependencies can be easily modeled.
The chunk structure, despite its importance, has not been considered in the
decoders used for neural machine translation (NMT). In this paper, we propose
chunk-based decoders for (NMT), each of which consists of a chunk-level decoder
and a word-level decoder. The chunk-level decoder models global dependencies
while the word-level decoder decides the local word order in a chunk. To output
a target sentence, the chunk-level decoder generates a chunk representation
containing global information, which the word-level decoder then uses as a
basis to predict the words inside the chunk. Experimental results show that our
proposed decoders can significantly improve translation performance in a WAT
'16 English-to-Japanese translation task.
