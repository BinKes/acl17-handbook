Abstract#==#Counselor empathy is associated with better outcomes in psychology and
behavioral counseling. In this paper, we explore several aspects pertaining to
counseling interaction dynamics and their relation to counselor empathy during
motivational interviewing encounters. Particularly, we analyze aspects such as
participants' engagement, participants' verbal and nonverbal accommodation, as
well as topics being discussed during the conversation, with the final goal of
identifying linguistic and acoustic markers of counselor empathy. We also show
how we can use these findings alongside other raw linguistic and acoustic
features to  build accurate counselor empathy classifiers with accuracies of up
to 80%.
