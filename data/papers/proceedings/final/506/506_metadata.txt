Abstract#==#Cross-lingual text classification(CLTC) is the task of classifying documents
written in different languages into the same taxonomy of categories. 
This paper presents a novel approach to CLTC that builds on model distillation,
which adapts and extends a framework originally proposed for model compression.
Using soft probabilistic predictions for the documents in a label-rich language
as the (induced) supervisory labels in a parallel corpus of documents, we train
classifiers successfully for new languages in which labeled training data are
not available. An adversarial feature adaptation technique is also applied
during the model training to reduce distribution mismatch. We conducted
experiments on two benchmark CLTC datasets, treating English as the source
language and German, French, Japan and Chinese as the unlabeled target
languages. The proposed approach had the advantageous or comparable performance
of the other state-of-art methods.
