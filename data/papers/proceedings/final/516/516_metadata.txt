Abstract#==#Interactive topic models are powerful tools
for those seeking to understand large
collections of text. However, existing
sampling-based interactive topic modeling
approaches scale poorly to large data sets.
Anchor methods, which use a single word
to uniquely identify a topic, offer the speed
needed for interactive work but lack both
a mechanism to inject prior knowledge
and lack the intuitive semantics needed
for user-facing applications. We propose
combinations of words as anchors, go-
ing beyond existing single word anchor
algorithms—an approach we call “Tan-
dem Anchors”. We begin with a synthetic
investigation of this approach then apply
the approach to interactive topic modeling
in a user study and compare it to interac-
tive and non-interactive approaches. Tan-
dem anchors are faster and more intuitive
than existing interactive approaches.
