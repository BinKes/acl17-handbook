Abstract#==#Accurate detection of emotion from natural language has applications ranging
from building emotional chatbots to better understanding individuals and their
lives. However, progress on emotion detection has been hampered by the absence
of large labeled datasets.  In this work, we build a very large dataset for
fine-grained emotions and develop deep learning models on it. We achieve a new
state-of-the-art on 24 fine-grained types of emotions (with an average accuracy
of 87.58%). We also extend the task beyond emotion types to model Robert
Plutick's 8 primary emotion dimensions, acquiring a superior accuracy of
95.68%.
