Abstract#==#Previous work has modeled the compositionality of words by creating
character-level models of meaning, reducing problems of sparsity for rare
words. However, in many writing systems compositionality has an effect even on
the character-level: the meaning of a character is derived by the sum of its
parts. In this paper, we model this effect by creating embeddings for
characters based on their visual characteristics, creating an image for the
character and running it through a convolutional neural network to produce a
visual character embedding. Experiments on a text classification task
demonstrate that such model allows for better processing of instances with rare
characters in languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Additionally,
qualitative analyses demonstrate that our proposed model learns to focus on the
parts of characters that carry topical content which resulting in embeddings
that are coherent in visual space.
