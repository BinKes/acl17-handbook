Abstract#==#Fixed-vocabulary language models fail to account for one of the most
characteristic statistical facts of natural language: the frequent creation and
reuse of new word types. Although character-level language models offer a
partial solution in that they can create word types not attested in the
training corpus, they do not capture the ``bursty'' distribution of such words.
In this paper, we augment a hierarchical LSTM language model that generates
sequences of word tokens character by character with a caching mechanism that
learns to reuse previously generated words. 
To validate our model we construct a new open-vocabulary language modeling
corpus (the Multilingual Wikipedia Corpus; MWC) from comparable Wikipedia
articles in 7 typologically diverse languages and demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model across this range of languages.
