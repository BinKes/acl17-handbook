Abstract#==#To enable human-robot communication and collaboration, previous works represent
grounded verb semantics as the potential change of state to the physical world
caused by these verbs. Grounded verb semantics are acquired mainly based on the
parallel data of the use of a verb phrase and its corresponding sequences of
primitive actions demonstrated by humans. The
rich interaction between teachers and students that is considered important in
learning new skills has not yet been explored. To address this limitation, this
paper presents a new interactive learning approach that allows robots to
proactively engage in interaction with human partners by asking good questions
to learn models for grounded verb semantics. The proposed approach uses
reinforcement learning to allow the robot to acquire an optimal policy for its
question-asking behaviors by maximizing the long-term reward. Our empirical
results have shown that the interactive learning approach leads to more
reliable models for grounded verb semantics, especially in the noisy
environment which is full of uncertainties. Compared to previous work, the
models acquired from interactive learning result in a 48% to 145% performance
gain when applied in new situations.
