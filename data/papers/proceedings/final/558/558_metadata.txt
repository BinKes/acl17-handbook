Abstract#==#Abstractive summarization is the ultimate goal of document summarization
research, but previously it is less investigated due to the immaturity of text
generation techniques. Recently impressive progress has been made to
abstractive sentence summarization using neural models. Unfortunately, attempts
on abstractive document summarization are still in a primitive stage, and the
evaluation results are worse than extractive methods on benchmark datasets. In
this paper, we review the difficulties of neural abstractive document
summarization, and propose a novel graph-based attention mechanism in the
sequence-to-sequence framework. The intuition is to address the saliency factor
of summarization, which has been overlooked by prior works. Experimental
results demonstrate our model is able to achieve considerable improvement over
previous neural abstractive models. The data-driven neural abstractive method
is also competitive with state-of-the-art extractive methods.
