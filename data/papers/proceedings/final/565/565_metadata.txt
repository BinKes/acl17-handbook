Abstract#==#Vector space representations of words capture many aspects of word similarity,
but such methods tend to produce vector spaces in which antonyms (as well as
synonyms) are close to each other. For spectral clustering using such word
embeddings, words are points in a vector space where synonyms are linked with
positive weights, while antonyms are linked with negative weights. We present a
new signed spectral normalized graph cut algorithm, {\em signed clustering},
that overlays existing thesauri upon distributionally derived vector
representations of words, so that antonym relationships between word pairs are
represented by negative weights. Our signed clustering algorithm produces
clusters of words that simultaneously capture distributional and synonym
relations.  
By using randomized spectral decomposition (Halko et al., 2011) and sparse
matrices, our method is both fast and scalable. We validate our clusters using
datasets containing human judgments of word pair similarities and show the
benefit of using our word clusters for sentiment prediction.
