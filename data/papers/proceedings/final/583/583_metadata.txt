Abstract#==#The sociolinguistic construct of stancetaking describes the activities through
which discourse participants create and signal relationships to their
interlocutors, to the topic of discussion, and to the talk itself. Stancetaking
underlies a wide range of interactional phenomena, relating to formality,
politeness, affect, and subjectivity. We present a computational approach to
stancetaking, in which we build a theoretically-motivated lexicon of stance
markers, and then use multidimensional analysis to identify a set of underlying
stance dimensions. We validate these dimensions intrinscially and
extrinsically, showing that they are internally coherent, match pre-registered
hypotheses, and correlate with social phenomena.
