Abstract#==#We study the problem of semi-supervised question answering----utilizing
unlabeled text to boost the performance of question answering models. We
propose a novel training framework, the \textit{Generative Domain-Adaptive
Nets}. In this framework, we train a generative model to generate questions
based on the unlabeled text, and combine model-generated questions with
human-generated questions for training question answering models. We develop
novel domain adaptation algorithms, based on reinforcement learning, to
alleviate the discrepancy between the model-generated data distribution and the
human-generated data distribution. Experiments show that our proposed framework
obtains substantial improvement from unlabeled text.
