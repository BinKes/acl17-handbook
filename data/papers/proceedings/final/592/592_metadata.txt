Abstract#==#Two types of data shift common in practice are 1. transferring from synthetic
data to live user data (a deployment shift), and
2. transferring from stale data to current data (a temporal shift). Both cause
a distribution mismatch between training and evaluation, leading to a model
that overfits the flawed training data and performs poorly on the test data. We
propose a solution to this mismatch problem by framing it as domain adaptation,
treating the flawed training dataset as a source domain and
the evaluation dataset as a target domain. To this end, we use and build on
several recent advances in neural domain adaptation such as adversarial
training (Ganinet al., 2016) and domain separation network (Bousmalis et al.,
2016), proposing a new effective adversarial training scheme. In both
supervised and unsupervised adaptation scenarios, our approach yields clear
improvement over strong baselines.
