Abstract#==#Despite sequences being core to NLP, scant work has considered how to handle
noisy sequence labels from multiple annotators for the same text. Given such
annotations, we consider two complementary tasks:  (1) aggregating sequential
crowd labels to infer a best single set of consensus annotations; and (2) using
crowd annotations as training data for a model that can predict sequences in
unannotated text. For aggregation, we propose a novel Hidden Markov Model
variant. To predict sequences in unannotated text, we propose a neural approach
using Long Short Term Memory. We evaluate a suite of methods across two
different applications and text genres: Named-Entity Recognition in news
articles and Information Extraction from biomedical abstracts. Results show
improvement over strong baselines. Our source code and data are available
online.
