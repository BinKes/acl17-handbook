Abstract#==#We present a deep neural architecture that parses sentences into three semantic
dependency graph formalisms. By using efficient, nearly arc-factored inference
and a bidirectional-LSTM composed with a multi-layer perceptron,  our base
system is able to significantly improve the state of the art for semantic
dependency parsing, without using hand-engineered features or syntax. We then
explore two multitask learning approaches---one that shares parameters across
formalisms, and one that uses higher-order structures to predict the graphs
jointly. We find that both approaches improve performance across formalisms on
average, achieving a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and
available at https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/NeurboParser.
