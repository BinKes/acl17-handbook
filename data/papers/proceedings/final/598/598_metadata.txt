Abstract#==#Bandit structured prediction describes a stochastic optimization framework
where learning is performed from partial feedback. This feedback is received in
the form of a task loss evaluation to a predicted output structure, without
having access to gold standard structures. We advance this framework by lifting
linear bandit learning to neural sequence-to-sequence learning problems using
attention-based recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we show how to
incorporate control variates into our learning algorithms for variance
reduction and improved generalization. We present an evaluation on a neural
machine translation task that shows improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU points for
domain adaptation from simulated bandit feedback.
