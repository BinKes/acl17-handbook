Abstract#==#Global constraints and reranking have not been used in cognates detection
research to date. We propose methods for using global constraints by performing
rescoring of the score matrices produced by state of the art cognates detection
systems. Using global constraints to perform rescoring is complementary to
state of the art methods for performing cognates detection and results in
significant performance improvements beyond current state of the art
performance on publicly available datasets with different language pairs and
various conditions such as different levels of baseline state of the art
performance and different data size conditions, including with more realistic
large data size conditions than have been evaluated with in the past.
