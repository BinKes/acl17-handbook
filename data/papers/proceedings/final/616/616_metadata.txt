Abstract#==#Automatic political orientation prediction from social media posts has to date
proven successful only in distinguishing between publicly declared liberals and
conservatives in the US. This study examines users’ political ideology using
a seven-point scale which enables us to identify politically moderate and
neutral users – groups which are of particular interest to political
scientists and pollsters. Using a novel data set with political ideology labels
self-reported through surveys, our goal is two-fold: a) to characterize the
groups of politically engaged users through language use on Twitter; b) to
build a fine-grained model that predicts political ideology of unseen users.
Our results identify differences in both political leaning and engagement and
the extent to which each group tweets using political keywords. Finally, we
demonstrate how to improve ideology prediction accuracy by exploiting the
relationships between the user groups.
