Abstract#==#Cybersecurity risks and malware threats are becoming increasingly dangerous and
common. Despite the severity of the problem, there has been few NLP efforts
focused on tackling cybersecurity.

In this paper, we discuss the construction of a new database for annotated
malware texts. An annotation framework is introduced based on the MAEC
vocabulary for defining malware characteristics, along with a database
consisting of 39 annotated APT reports with a total of 6,819 sentences. We also
use the database to construct models that can potentially help cybersecurity
researchers in their data collection and analytics efforts.
