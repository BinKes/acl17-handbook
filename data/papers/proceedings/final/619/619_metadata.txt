Abstract#==#This paper presents ArgRewrite, a corpus of between-draft revisions of
argumentative essays. Drafts are manually aligned at the sentence level, and
the writerâ€™s purpose for each revision is annotated with categories analogous
to those used in argument mining and discourse analysis. The corpus should
enable advanced research in writing comparison and revision analysis, as
demonstrated via our own studies of student revision behavior and of automatic
revision purpose prediction.
