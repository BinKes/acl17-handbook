Abstract#==#This paper proposes KB-InfoBot - a multi-turn dialogue agent which helps users
search Knowledge Bases (KBs) without composing complicated queries. Such
goal-oriented dialogue agents typically need to interact with an external
database to access real-world knowledge. Previous systems achieved this by
issuing a symbolic query to the KB to retrieve entries based on their
attributes. However, such symbolic operations break the differentiability of
the system and prevent end-to-end training of neural dialogue agents. In this
paper, we address this limitation by replacing symbolic queries with an induced
``soft'' posterior distribution over the KB that indicates which entities the
user is interested in. Integrating the soft retrieval process with a
reinforcement learner leads to higher task success rate and reward in both
simulations and against real users. We also present a fully neural end-to-end
agent, trained entirely from user feedback, and discuss its application towards
personalized dialogue agents.
