Abstract#==#We propose a novel geolocation prediction model using a complex neural network.
Geolocation prediction in social media has attracted many researchers to use
information of various types. Our model unifies text, metadata, and user
network representations with an attention mechanism to overcome previous
ensemble approaches. In an evaluation using two open datasets, the proposed
model exhibited a maximum 3.8% increase in accuracy and a maximum of 6.6%
increase in accuracy@161 against previous models. We further analyzed several
intermediate layers of our model, which revealed that their states capture some
statistical characteristics of the datasets.
