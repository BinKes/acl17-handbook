Abstract#==#Automatically evaluating the quality of dialogue responses for unstructured
domains is a challenging problem.  Unfortunately, existing automatic evaluation
metrics are biased and correlate very poorly with human judgements of response
quality (Liu et al., 2016). Yet having an accurate automatic evaluation
procedure is crucial for dialogue research, as it allows rapid prototyping and
testing of new models with fewer expensive human evaluations. In response to
this challenge, we formulate automatic dialogue evaluation as a learning
problem.We present an evaluation model (ADEM)that learns to predict human-like
scores to input responses, using a new dataset of human response scores.   We
show that the ADEM modelâ€™s predictions correlate significantly,  and at a
level much higher than word-overlap metrics such as BLEU, with human judgements
at both the utterance and system-level. We also show that ADEM can generalize
to evaluating dialogue mod-els unseen during training,                    an
important step
for
automatic dialogue evaluation.
