Abstract#==#We propose a perspective on dialogue that focuses on relative information
contributions of conversation partners as a key to successful communication. We
predict the success of collaborative task in English and Danish corpora of
task-oriented dialogue. Two features are extracted from the frequency domain
representations of  the lexical entropy series of each interlocutor, power
spectrum overlap (PSO) and relative phase (RP). We find that PSO is a negative
predictor of task success, while RP is a positive one. An SVM with these
features significantly improved on previous task success prediction models. Our
findings suggest that the strategic distribution of information density between
interlocutors  is relevant to task success.
