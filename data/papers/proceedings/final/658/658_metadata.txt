Abstract#==#We introduce a composite deep neural network architecture for supervised and
language independent context sensitive lemmatization. The proposed method
considers the task as to identify the correct edit tree representing the
transformation between a word-lemma pair. To find the lemma of a surface word,
we exploit two successive bidirectional gated recurrent structures - the first
one is used to extract the character level dependencies and the next one
captures the contextual information of the given word. The key advantages of
our model compared to the state-of-the-art lemmatizers such as Lemming and
Morfette are - (i) it is independent of human decided features (ii) except the
gold lemma, no other expensive morphological attribute is required for joint
learning. We evaluate the lemmatizer on nine languages - Bengali, Catalan,
Dutch, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Latin, Romanian and Spanish. It is found that
except Bengali, the proposed method outperforms Lemming and Morfette on the
other languages. To train the model on Bengali, we develop a gold lemma
annotated dataset (having 1,702 sentences with a total of 20,257 word tokens),
which is an additional contribution of this work.
