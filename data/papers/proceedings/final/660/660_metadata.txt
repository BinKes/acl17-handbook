Abstract#==#We propose two novel methodologies for the automatic generation of rhythmic
poetry in a variety of forms. The first approach uses a neural language model
trained on a phonetic encoding to learn an implicit representation of both the
form and content of English poetry. This model can effectively learn common
poetic devices such as rhyme, rhythm and alliteration. The second approach
considers poetry generation as a constraint satisfaction problem where a
generative neural language model is tasked with learning a representation of
content, and a discriminative weighted finite state machine constrains it on
the basis of form. By manipulating the constraints of the latter model, we can
generate coherent poetry with arbitrary forms and themes. A large-scale
extrinsic evaluation demonstrated that participants consider machine-generated
poems to be written by humans 54% of the time. In addition, participants rated
a machine-generated poem to be the best amongst all evaluated.
