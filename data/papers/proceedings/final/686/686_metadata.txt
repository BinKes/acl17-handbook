Abstract#==#Word-level language detection is necessary for analyzing code-switched text,
where multiple languages could be mixed within a sentence. Existing models are
restricted to code-switching between two specific languages and fail in
real-world scenarios as text input rarely has a priori information on the
languages used. We present a novel unsupervised word-level language detection
technique for code-switched text for an arbitrarily large number of languages,
which does not require any manually annotated training data. Our experiments
with tweets in seven languages show a 74% relative error reduction in
word-level labeling with respect to competitive baselines. We then use this
system to conduct a large-scale quantitative analysis of code-switching
patterns on Twitter, both global as well as region-specific, with 58M tweets.
