Abstract#==#Understanding common entities and their attributes is a primary requirement for
any system that comprehends natural language. In order to enable learning about
common entities, we introduce a novel machine comprehension task, GuessTwo:
given a short paragraph comparing different aspects of two real-world
semantically-similar entities, a system should guess what those entities are.
Accomplishing this task requires deep language understanding which enables
inference, connecting each comparison paragraph to different levels of
knowledge about world entities and their attributes. So far we have
crowdsourced a dataset of more than 14K comparison paragraphs comparing
entities from a variety of categories such as fruits and animals. We have
designed two schemes for evaluation: open-ended, and binary-choice prediction.
For benchmarking further progress in the task, we have collected a set of
paragraphs as the test set on which human can accomplish the task with an
accuracy of 94.2\% on open-ended prediction. We have implemented various models
for tackling the task, ranging from semantic-driven to neural models. The
semantic-driven approach outperforms the neural models, however, the results
indicate that the task is very challenging across the models.
