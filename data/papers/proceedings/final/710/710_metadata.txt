Abstract#==#Cultural fit is widely believed to affect the success of individuals and the
groups to which they belong. Yet it remains an elusive, poorly measured
construct. Recent research draws on computational linguistics to measure
cultural fit but overlooks asymmetries in cultural adaptation. By contrast, we
develop a directed, dynamic measure of cultural fit based on linguistic
alignment, which estimates the influence of one person's word use on another's
and distinguishes between two enculturation mechanisms: internalization and
self-regulation. We use this measure to trace employees' enculturation
trajectories over a large, multi-year corpus of corporate emails and find that
patterns of alignment in the first six months of employment are predictive of
individualsâ€™ downstream outcomes, especially involuntary exit. Further
predictive analyses suggest referential alignment plays an overlooked role in
linguistic alignment.
