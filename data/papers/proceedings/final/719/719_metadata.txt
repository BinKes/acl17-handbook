Abstract#==#In this paper, we study how to improve the
domain adaptability of a deletion-based
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for sentence compression. We
hypothesize that syntactic information helps in making such models
more robust across domains. We propose two major changes to the model: using
explicit syntactic features and introducing syntactic constraints through
Integer Linear Programming (ILP). Our evaluation
shows that the proposed model works better than the original model as well as a
traditional non-neural-network-based model
in a cross-domain setting.
