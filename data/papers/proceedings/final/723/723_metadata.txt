Abstract#==#We present in this paper a novel framework for morpheme segmentation which uses
the morpho-syntactic regularities preserved by word representations, in
addition to orthographic features, to segment words into morphemes. This
framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic 
information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies  of  available
benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the
basis of compositionality.  We validate our algorithm across datasets and
present state-of-the-art results.
