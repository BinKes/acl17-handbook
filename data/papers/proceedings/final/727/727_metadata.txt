Abstract#==#Framing is a political strategy in which politicians carefully word their
statements in order to control public perception of issues. Previous works
exploring political framing typically analyze frame usage in longer texts, such
as congressional speeches. We present a collection of weakly supervised models
which harness collective classification to predict the frames used in political
discourse on the microblogging platform, Twitter. Our global probabilistic
models show that by combining both lexical features of tweets and network-based
behavioral features of Twitter, we are able to increase the average,
unsupervised F1 score by 21.52 points over a lexical baseline alone.
