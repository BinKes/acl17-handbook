Abstract#==#How fake news goes viral via social media? How does its propagation pattern
differ from real stories? In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of
identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on
their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with
propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is
transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method
called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns
differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities
between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can
detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-of-the-art rumor detection
models.
