Abstract#==#Domain adaptation is an important technology to handle domain dependence
problem in sentiment analysis field. Existing methods usually rely on sentiment
classifiers trained in source domains. However, their performance may heavily
decline if the distributions of sentiment features in source and target domains
have significant difference. In this paper, we propose an active sentiment
domain adaptation approach to handle this problem. Instead of the source domain
sentiment classifiers, our approach adapts the general-purpose sentiment
lexicons to target domain with the help of a small number of labeled samples
which are selected and annotated in an active learning mode, as well as the
domain-specific sentiment similarities among words mined from unlabeled samples
of target domain. A unified model is proposed to fuse different types of
sentiment information and train sentiment classifier for target domain.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach can train
accurate sentiment classifier with less labeled samples.
