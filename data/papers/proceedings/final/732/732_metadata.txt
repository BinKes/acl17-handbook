Abstract#==#Linguistic typology studies the range of structures present in human language.
The main goal of the field is to discover which sets of possible phenomena are
universal, and which are merely frequent. For example, all languages have
vowels, while most---but not all---languages have an /u/ sound. In this paper
we present the first probabilistic treatment of a basic question in
phonological typology: What makes a natural vowel inventory?  We introduce a
series of deep stochastic point processes, and contrast them with previous
computational, simulation-based approaches.  We provide a comprehensive suite
of experiments on over 200 distinct languages.
