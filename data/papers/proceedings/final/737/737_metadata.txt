Abstract#==#We present TriviaQA, a challenging reading comprehension dataset containing
over 650K question-answer-evidence triples. TriviaQA includes 95K
question-answer  pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently
gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high
quality distant supervision for answering the questions. We show that, in
comparison to other recently introduced large-scale datasets, TriviaQA (1) has
relatively complex, compositional questions,  (2)  has considerable 
syntactic and  lexical                                      variability  between     
     
questions and 
corresponding 
answer-evidence  sentences,  and  (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to
find answers.  We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature-based
classifier and a state-of-the-art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD
reading comprehension. Neither approach comes close to human performance (23%
and 40% vs. 80%), suggesting that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that is
worth significant future study.
