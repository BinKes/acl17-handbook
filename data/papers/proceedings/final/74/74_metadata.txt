Abstract#==#Kernel methods enable the direct usage of structured representations of textual
data during language learning and inference tasks. Expressive kernels, such as
Tree Kernels, achieve excellent performance in NLP. 
On the other side, deep neural networks have been demonstrated effective in
automatically learning feature representations during training. However, their
input is tensor data, i.e., they can not manage rich structured information.
In this paper, we show that expressive kernels and deep neural networks can be
combined in a common framework in order to (i) explicitly model structured
information and (ii) learn non-linear decision functions. We show that the
input layer of a deep architecture can be pre-trained through the application
of the Nystrom low-rank approximation of kernel spaces. 
The resulting ``kernelized" neural network achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
in three different tasks.
