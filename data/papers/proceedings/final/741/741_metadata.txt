Abstract#==#This paper presents a new graph-based approach that induces synsets using
synonymy dictionaries and word embeddings. First, we build a weighted graph of
synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary.
Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we
cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets.
Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm
to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our
approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive
state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets
for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical
resources.
