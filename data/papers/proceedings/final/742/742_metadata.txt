Abstract#==#Although neural machine translation has made significant progress recently, how
to integrate multiple overlapping, arbitrary prior knowledge sources remains a
challenge. In this work, we propose to use posterior regularization to provide
a general framework for integrating prior knowledge into neural machine
translation. We represent prior knowledge sources as features in a log-linear
model, which guides the learning processing of the neural translation model.
Experiments on Chinese-English dataset show that our approach leads to
significant improvements.
