Abstract#==#Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized deep
multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication channel.
While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of their
induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we propose to
interpret agents' messages by translating them.  Unlike in typical machine
translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we
develop
a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural
language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about
the world in a listener.  We present theoretical guarantees and empirical
evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of
messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do
not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common
language.
