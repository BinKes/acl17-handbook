Abstract#==#We present a joint modeling approach to identify salient discussion points in
spoken meetings as well as to label the discourse relations between speaker
turns. A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are
treated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting
corpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches
for both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction
tasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team
members' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with
features constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive
performance than the state-of-the-art.
