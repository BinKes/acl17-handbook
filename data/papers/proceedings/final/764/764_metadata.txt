Abstract#==#Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and
complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal
conversation between two humans. In an effort to explore a conversational QA
setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but
inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that
inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553
question-answer pairs in total. To solve this sequential question answering
task, we propose a novel dynamic neural semantic parsing framework trained
using a weakly supervised reward-guided search. Our model effectively leverages
the sequential context to outperform state-of-the-art QA systems that are
designed to answer highly complex questions.
