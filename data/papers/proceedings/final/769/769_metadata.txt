Abstract#==#We study a \emph{symmetric collaborative dialogue} setting
in which two agents, each with private knowledge,
must strategically communicate to achieve a common goal.
The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing
dialogue systems.
We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues,
which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements.
To model
both structured knowledge and unstructured language,
we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings
that evolve as the dialogue progresses.
Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective
at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based
models.
