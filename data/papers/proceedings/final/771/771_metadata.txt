Abstract#==#An interesting aspect of structured prediction is the evaluation of an output
structure against the gold standard. Especially in the loss-augmented setting,
the need of finding the max-violating constraint has severely limited the
expressivity of effective loss functions.
In this paper, we trade off exact computation for enabling the use and study of
more complex loss functions for coreference resolution. Most interestingly, we
show that such functions can be (i) automatically learned also from
controversial but commonly accepted coreference measures, e.g., MELA, and (ii)
successfully used in learning algorithms. The accurate model comparison on the
standard CoNLL-2012 setting shows the benefit of more expressive loss
functions.
