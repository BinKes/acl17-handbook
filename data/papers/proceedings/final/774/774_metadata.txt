Abstract#==#Our goal is to learn a semantic parser that maps natural language utterances
into executable programs when only indirect supervision is available: examples
are labeled with the correct execution result, but not the program itself.
Consequently, we must search the space of programs for those that output the
correct result, while not being misled by \emph{spurious programs}: incorrect
programs that coincidentally output the correct result. We connect two common
learning paradigms, reinforcement learning (RL) and maximum marginal likelihood
(MML), and then present a new learning algorithm that combines the strengths of
both. The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the
systematic search traditionally employed in MML with the randomized exploration
of RL, and by updating parameters such that probability is spread more evenly
across consistent programs. We apply our learning algorithm to a new neural
semantic parser and show significant gains over existing state-of-the-art
results on a recent context-dependent semantic parsing task.
