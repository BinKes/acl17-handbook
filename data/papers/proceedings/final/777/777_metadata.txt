Abstract#==#We presents in this paper our approach for modeling inter-topic preferences of
Twitter
users: for example, "those who agree with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
also agree
with free trade". This kind of knowledge is useful not only for stance
detection across multiple topics but also for various real-world applications
including public opinion survey,
electoral prediction, electoral campaigns, and online debates. In order to
extract
users' preferences on Twitter, we design linguistic patterns in which people
agree
and disagree about specific topics (e.g., "A is completely wrong'').
By applying these linguistic patterns to a collection of tweets, we extract
statements agreeing and disagreeing with various topics. Inspired by previous
work on
item recommendation, we formalize the task of modeling inter-topic preferences
as matrix factorization: representing users' preference as a user-topic matrix
and mapping both users and topics onto a latent feature space that abstracts
the preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate both that our presented
approach is useful in predicting missing preferences of users and that the
latent vector representations of topics successfully encode inter-topic
preferences.
