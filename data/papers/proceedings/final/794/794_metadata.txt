Abstract#==#An important problem in domain adaptation is to quickly generalize to a new
domain with limited supervision given K existing domains. One approach is to
retrain a global model across all K + 1 domains using standard techniques, for
instance Daum´e III (2009). However, it is desirable to adapt without having
to re-estimate a global model from scratch each time a new domain with
potentially new intents and slots is added. We describe a solution based on
attending an ensemble of domain experts. We assume K domain specific intent and
slot models trained on respective domains. When given domain K + 1, our model
uses a weighted combination of the K domain experts’ feedback along with its
own opinion to make predictions on the new domain. In experiments,
the model significantly outperforms baselines that do not use domain adaptation
and also performs better than the full retraining approach.
