Abstract#==#We present a simple encoding for unlabeled noncrossing graphs and show how its
latent counterpart helps us to represent several families of directed and
undirected graphs used in syntactic and semantic parsing of natural language as
context-free languages.  The families are separated purely on the basis of
forbidden patterns in latent encoding, eliminating the need to differentiate
the families of non-crossing graphs in inference algorithms: one algorithm
works for all when the search space can be controlled in parser input.
