Abstract#==#In this work, we present a minimal neural model for constituency parsing based
on independent scoring of labels and spans. We show that this model is not only
compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a
novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of
the input. We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are
competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the
scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model
performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the
French Treebank (82.23 F1).
