Abstract#==#Text similarity measures are used in multiple tasks such as plagiarism
detection, information ranking and recognition of paraphrases and textual
entailment. While recent advances in deep learning highlighted the relevance of
sequential models in natural language generation, existing similarity measures
do not fully exploit the sequential nature of language. Examples of such
similarity measures include n-grams and skip-grams overlap which rely on
distinct slices of the input texts. In this paper we present a novel text
similarity measure inspired from a common representation in DNA sequence
alignment algorithms. The new measure, called TextFlow, represents input text
pairs as continuous curves and uses both the actual position of the words and
sequence matching to compute the similarity value. Our experiments on 8
different datasets show very encouraging results in paraphrase detection,
textual entailment recognition and ranking relevance.
