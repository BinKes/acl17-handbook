Abstract#==#While joint models have been developed for many NLP tasks, the vast majority of
event coreference resolvers, including the top-performing resolvers competing
in the recent TAC KBP 2016 Event Nugget Detection and Coreference task, are
pipeline-based, where the propagation of errors from the trigger detection
component to the event coreference component is a major performance limiting
factor. To address this problem, we propose a model for jointly learning event
coreference, trigger detection, and event anaphoricity. Our joint model is
novel in its choice of tasks and its features for capturing cross-task
interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to train a
mention-ranking model and employ event anaphoricity for event coreference. Our
model achieves the best results to date on the KBP 2016 English and Chinese
datasets.
