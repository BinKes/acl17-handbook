Abstract#==#We have been developing an end-to-end math problem solving system that accepts
natural language input.
The current paper focuses on how we analyze the problem sentences to produce
logical forms.
We chose a hybrid approach combining a shallow syntactic analyzer and a
manually-developed lexicalized grammar.
A feature of the grammar is that it is extensively typed on the basis of a
formal ontology for pre-university math.
These types are helpful in semantic disambiguation inside and across sentences.
Experimental results show that the hybrid system produces a well-formed logical
form with 88\% precision and 56\% recall.
