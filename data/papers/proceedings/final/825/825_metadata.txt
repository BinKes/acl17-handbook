Abstract#==#Though feature extraction is a necessary first step in statistical NLP, it is
often seen as a mere preprocessing step. Yet, it can dominate computation time,
both during training, and especially at deployment. In this paper, we formalize
feature extraction from an algebraic perspective. Our formalization allows us
to define a message passing algorithm that can restructure feature templates to
be more computationally efficient. We show via experiments on text chunking and
relation extraction that this restructuring does indeed speed up feature
extraction in practice by reducing redundant computation.
