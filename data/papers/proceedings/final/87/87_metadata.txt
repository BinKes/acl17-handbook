Abstract#==#The large and growing amounts of online scholarly data present both challenges
and opportunities to enhance knowledge discovery. One such challenge is to
automatically extract a small set of keyphrases from a document that can
accurately describe the document's content and can facilitate fast information
processing. In this paper, we propose PositionRank, an unsupervised 
model for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents that incorporates
information from all positions of a word's occurrences into a biased PageRank.
Our model obtains remarkable improvements in performance over PageRank models
that do not take into account word positions as well as over strong baselines
for this task. 
Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, PositionRank achieves
improvements as high as $29.09\%$.
