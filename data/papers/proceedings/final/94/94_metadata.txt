Abstract#==#Restricted non-monotonicity has been shown beneficial for the projective
arc-eager dependency parser in previous research, as posterior decisions can
repair mistakes made in previous states due to the lack of information. In this
paper, we propose a novel, fully non-monotonic transition system based on the
non-projective Covington algorithm. As a non-monotonic system requires
exploration of erroneous actions during the training process, we develop
several non-monotonic variants of the recently defined dynamic oracle for the
Covington parser, based on tight approximations of the loss. Experiments on
datasets from the CoNLL-X and CoNLL-XI shared tasks show that a non-monotonic
dynamic oracle outperforms the monotonic version in the majority of languages.
