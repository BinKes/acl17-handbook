Abstract#==#Sarcasm is a form of speech in which speakers say the opposite of what they
truly mean in order to convey a strong sentiment. In other words, ”Sarcasm is
the giant chasm between what I say, and the person who doesn’t get it.”. In
this paper we present the novel task of sarcasm interpretation, defined as the
generation of a non-sarcastic utterance conveying the same message as the
original sarcastic one. We introduce a novel dataset of 3000 sarcastic tweets,
each interpreted by five human judges. Addressing the task as monolingual
machine translation (MT), we experiment with MT algorithms and evaluation
measures. We then present SIGN:
an MT based sarcasm interpretation algorithm that targets sentiment words, a
defining element of textual sarcasm. We show that while the scores of n-gram
based automatic measures are similar for all interpretation models, SIGN’s
interpretations are scored higher by humans for adequacy and sentiment
polarity. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions for our
new task.
