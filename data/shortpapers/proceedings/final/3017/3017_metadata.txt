Abstract#==#We propose novel radical features from automatic translation for event
extraction.
Event detection is a complex language processing task for which it is expensive
to collect training data, making generalisation challenging. 
We derive meaningful subword features from automatic translations into target
language.
Results suggest this method is particularly useful when using languages with
writing systems that facilitate easy decomposition into subword features, e.g.,
logograms and Cangjie.
The best result combines logogram features from Chinese and Japanese with
syllable features from Korean, providing an additional 3.0 points f-score when
added to state-of-the-art generalisation features on the TAC KBP 2015 Event
Nugget task.
