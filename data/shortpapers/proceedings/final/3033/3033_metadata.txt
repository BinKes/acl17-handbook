Abstract#==#In this paper, we address semantic parsing in a multilingual context. We train
one multilingual model that is capable of parsing natural language sentences
from multiple different languages into their corresponding formal semantic
representations. We extend an existing sequence-to-tree model to a multi-task
learning framework which shares the decoder for generating semantic
representations. We report evaluation results on the multilingual GeoQuery
corpus and introduce a new multilingual version of the ATIS corpus.
