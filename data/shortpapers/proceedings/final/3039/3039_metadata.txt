Abstract#==#Topical PageRank (TPR) uses latent topic distribution inferred by Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to perform ranking of noun phrases extracted from
documents. The ranking procedure consists of running PageRank K times, where K
is the number of topics used in the LDA model. In this paper, we propose a
modification of TPR, called Salience Rank. Salience Rank only needs to run
PageRank once and extracts comparable or better keyphrases on benchmark
datasets. In addition to quality and efficiency benefit, our method has the
flexibility to extract keyphrases with varying tradeoffs between topic
specificity and corpus specificity.
