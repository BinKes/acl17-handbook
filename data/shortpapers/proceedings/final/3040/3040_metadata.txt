Abstract#==#Traditional Entity Linking (EL) technologies rely on rich structures and
properties in the target knowledge base (KB). However, in many applications,
the KB may be as simple and sparse as lists of names of the same type (e.g.,
lists of products). We call it as List-only Entity Linking problem. 
Fortunately, some mentions may have more cues for linking, which can be used as
seed mentions to bridge other mentions and the uninformative entities. 
In this work, we select most linkable mentions as seed mentions and
disambiguate other mentions by comparing them with the seed mentions rather
than directly with the entities.
Our experiments on linking mentions to seven automatically mined lists show
promising results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
