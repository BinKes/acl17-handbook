Abstract#==#In this work, we propose a novel, implicitly-defined neural network
architecture
and describe a method to compute its components.
The proposed architecture forgoes the causality assumption
used to formulate recurrent neural networks
and instead couples the hidden states of the network,
allowing improvement on problems with complex, long-distance dependencies.
Initial experiments demonstrate the new architecture outperforms both the
Stanford Parser
and baseline bidirectional networks on the Penn Treebank Part-of-Speech tagging
task
and a baseline bidirectional network on an additional artificial random biased
walk task.
