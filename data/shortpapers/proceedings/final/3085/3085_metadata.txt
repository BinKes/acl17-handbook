Abstract#==#Neural models with minimal feature engineering have achieved competitive
performance against traditional methods for the task of Chinese word
segmentation. However, both training and working procedures of the current
neural models are computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a
greedy neural word segmenter with balanced word and character embedding inputs
to alleviate the existing drawbacks. Our segmenter is truly end-to-end, capable
of performing segmentation much faster and even more accurate than
state-of-the-art neural models on Chinese benchmark datasets.
