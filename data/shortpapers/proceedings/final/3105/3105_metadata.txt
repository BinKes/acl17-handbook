Abstract#==#A large amount of recent research has focused on 
tasks that combine language and vision, resulting in
a proliferation of datasets and methods. One such task is 
action recognition, whose applications
include image annotation, scene understanding and 
image retrieval. In this survey, we categorize the 
existing approaches based on how 
they conceptualize this problem  
and provide a detailed review of existing datasets, 
highlighting their diversity as well as advantages and
disadvantages. We focus on recently developed 
datasets which link visual information with
linguistic resources and provide a fine-grained syntactic and semantic 
analysis of actions in images.
