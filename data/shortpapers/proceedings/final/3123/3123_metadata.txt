Abstract#==#Traditionally, compound splitters are evaluated intrinsically on gold-standard
data or extrinsically on the task of statistical machine translation. We
explore a novel way for the extrinsic evaluation of compound splitters, namely
recognizing textual entailment. Compound splitting has great potential for this
novel task that is both transparent and well-defined. Moreover, we show that it
addresses certain aspects that are either ignored in intrinsic evaluations or
compensated for by taskinternal mechanisms in statistical machine translation.
We show significant improvements using different compound splitting methods on
a German textual entailment dataset.
