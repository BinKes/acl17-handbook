Abstract#==#This paper makes a focused contribution to supervised aspect extraction. It
shows that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domains
and retained their results as knowledge, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can
leverage this knowledge in a lifelong learning manner to extract in a new
domain markedly better than the traditional CRF without using this prior
knowledge. The key innovation is that even after CRF training, the model can
still improve its extraction with experiences in its applications.
