Abstract#==#We present a transition-based dependency parser that uses a convolutional
neural network to compose word representations from characters. The character
composition model shows great improvement over the word-lookup model,
especially
for parsing agglutinative languages. These improvements are even better than
using pre-trained word
embeddings from extra data. On the SPMRL data sets, our system outperforms the
previous best greedy parser (Ballesteros et. al, 2015) by a margin of 3% on
average.
