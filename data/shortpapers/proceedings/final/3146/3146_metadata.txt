Abstract#==#Generative models defining joint distributions over parse trees and sentences
are useful for parsing and language modeling, but impose restrictions on the
scope of features and are often outperformed by discriminative models. We
propose a framework for parsing and language modeling which marries a
generative model with a discriminative recognition model in an encoder-decoder
setting. We provide interpretations of the framework based on expectation
maximization and variational inference, and show that it enables parsing and
language modeling within a single implementation. On the English Penn
Treen-bank, our framework obtains competitive performance on constituency
parsing while matching the state-of-the-art single- model language modeling
score.
