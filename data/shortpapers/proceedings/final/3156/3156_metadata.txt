Abstract#==#Although new corpora are becoming increasingly available for machine
translation, only those that belong to the same or similar domains are
typically able to improve translation performance. Recently Neural Machine
Translation (NMT) has become prominent in the field. However, most of the
existing domain adaptation methods only focus on phrase-based machine
translation. In this paper, we exploit the NMT's internal embedding of the
source sentence and use the sentence embedding similarity to select the
sentences which are close to in-domain data. The empirical adaptation results
on the IWSLT English-French and NIST Chinese-English tasks show that the
proposed methods can substantially improve NMT performance by 2.4-9.0 BLEU
points, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art baseline by 2.3-4.5 BLEU
points.
