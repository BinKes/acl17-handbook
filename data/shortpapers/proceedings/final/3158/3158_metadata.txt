Abstract#==#In recent years, automatic generation of image descriptions (captions), that
is, image captioning, has attracted a great deal of attention.
In this paper, we particularly consider generating Japanese captions for
images.
Since most available caption datasets have been constructed for English
language, there are few datasets for Japanese.
To tackle this problem, we construct a large-scale Japanese image caption
dataset based on images from MS-COCO, which is called STAIR Captions.
STAIR Captions consists of 820,310 Japanese captions for 164,062 images.
In the experiment, we show that a neural network trained using STAIR Captions
can generate more natural and better Japanese captions, compared to those
generated using English-Japanese machine translation after generating English
captions.
