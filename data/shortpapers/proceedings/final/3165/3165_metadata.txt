Abstract#==#We evaluate feature hashing for language identification (LID), a method not
previously used for this task. Using a standard dataset, we first show that
while feature performance is high, LID data is highly dimensional and mostly
sparse (>99.5%) as it includes large vocabularies for many languages; memory
requirements grow as languages are added. Next we apply hashing using various
hash sizes, demonstrating that there is no performance loss with dimensionality
reductions of up to 86%. We also show that using an ensemble of low-dimension
hash-based classifiers further boosts performance. Feature hashing is highly
useful for LID and holds great promise for future work in this area.
