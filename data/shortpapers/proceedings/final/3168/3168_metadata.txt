Abstract#==#Because syntactic structures and spans of multiword expressions (MWEs) are
independently annotated in many English syntactic corpora, they are generally
inconsistent with respect to one another, which is harmful to the
implementation of an aggregate system. In this work, we construct a corpus that
ensures consistency between dependency structures and MWEs, including named
entities. Further, we explore models that predict both MWE-spans and an
MWE-aware dependency structure. Experimental results show that our joint model
using additional MWE-span features achieves an MWE recognition improvement of
1.35 points over a pipeline model.
