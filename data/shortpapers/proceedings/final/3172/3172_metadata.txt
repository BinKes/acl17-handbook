Abstract#==#We propose a new method for extracting pseudo-parallel sentences from a pair of
large monolingual corpora, without relying on any document-level information.
Our method first exploits word embeddings in order to efficiently evaluate
trillions of candidate sentence pairs and then a classifier to find the most
reliable ones. We report significant improvements in domain adaptation for
statistical machine translation when using a translation model trained on the
sentence pairs extracted from in-domain monolingual corpora.
