Abstract#==#Generative conversational systems are attracting increasing attention in
natural language processing (NLP). Recently, researchers have noticed the
importance of context information in dialog processing, and built various
models to utilize context. However, there is no systematic comparison to
analyze how to use context effectively. In this paper, we conduct an empirical
study to compare various models and investigate the effect of context
information in dialog systems. We also propose a variant that explicitly
weights context vectors by context-query relevance, outperforming the other
baselines.
