Abstract#==#Parallel corpora are widely used in a variety of Natural Language Processing
tasks, from Machine Translation to cross-lingual Word Sense Disambiguation,
where parallel sentences can be exploited to automatically generate
high-quality sense annotations on a large scale. In this paper we present
EuroSense, a multilingual sense-annotated resource based on the joint
disambiguation of the Europarl parallel corpus, with almost 123 million sense
annotations for over 155 thousand distinct concepts and entities from a
language-independent unified sense inventory. We evaluate the quality of our
sense annotations intrinsically and extrinsically, showing their effectiveness
as training data for Word Sense Disambiguation.
