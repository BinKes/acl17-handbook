Abstract#==#In dependency parsing, jackknifing taggers is indiscriminately used as a simple
adaptation strategy. Here, we empirically evaluate when and how (not) to use
jackknifing in parsing. On 26 languages, we reveal a preference that conflicts
with, and surpasses the ubiquitous ten-folding. We show no clear benefits of
tagging the training data in cross-lingual parsing.
