Abstract#==#This paper focuses on the task of noisy label aggregation in social media,
where users with different social or culture backgrounds may annotate invalid
or malicious tags for documents. To aggregate noisy labels at a small cost, a
network framework is proposed by calculating the matching degree of a
document's topics and the annotators' meta-data. Unlike using the
back-propagation algorithm, a probabilistic inference approach is adopted to
estimate network parameters. Finally, a new simulation method is designed for
validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in aggregating noisy
labels.
