Abstract#==#We propose a novel generative neural network architecture for Dialogue Act
classification. Building upon the Recurrent Neural Network framework, our model
incorporates a novel attentional technique and a label to label connection for
sequence learning, akin to Hidden Markov Models. The experiments show that both
of these innovations lead  our model to outperform strong baselines for
dialogue act classification on MapTask and Switchboard corpora. We further
empirically analyse the effectiveness of each of the new innovations.
