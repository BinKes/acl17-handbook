Abstract#==#Count-based distributional semantic models suffer from sparsity due to
unobserved but plausible co-occurrences in any text collection. This problem is
amplified for models like Anchored Packed Trees (APTs), that take the
grammatical type of a co-occurrence into account. We therefore introduce a
novel form of distributional inference that exploits the rich type structure in
APTs and infers missing data by the same mechanism that is used for semantic
composition.
