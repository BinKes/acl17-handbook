Abstract#==#We design and release BONIE, the first open numerical relation extractor, for
extracting Open IE tuples where one of the arguments is a number or a
quantity-unit phrase. BONIE uses bootstrapping to learn the specific dependency
patterns that express numerical relations in a sentence. BONIE’s novelty lies
in task-specific customizations, such as inferring implicit relations, which
are clear due to context such as units (for e.g., ‘square kilometers’
suggests
area, even if the word ‘area’ is missing in the sentence). BONIE obtains
1.5x yield and 15 point precision gain on numerical facts over a
state-of-the-art Open IE system.
