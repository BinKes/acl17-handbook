Abstract#==#Many unsupervised learning techniques have been proposed to obtain meaningful
representations of words from text. In this study, we evaluate these various
techniques when used to generate Arabic word embeddings. We first build a
benchmark for the Arabic language that can be utilized to perform intrinsic
evaluation of different word embeddings. We then perform additional extrinsic
evaluations of the embeddings based on two NLP tasks.
