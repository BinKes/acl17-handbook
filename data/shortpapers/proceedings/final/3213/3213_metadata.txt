Abstract#==#Neural machine translation (NMT) becomes a new approach to machine translation
and generates much more fluent results compared to statistical machine
translation (SMT). However, SMT is usually better than NMT in translation
adequacy. It is therefore a promising direction to combine the advantages of
both NMT and SMT. In this paper, we propose a neural system combination
framework leveraging multi-source NMT, which takes as input the outputs of NMT
and SMT systems and produces the final translation. Extensive experiments on
the Chinese-to-English translation task show that our model archives
significant improvement by 5.3 BLEU points over the best single system output
and 3.4 BLEU points over the state-of-the-art traditional system combination
methods.
