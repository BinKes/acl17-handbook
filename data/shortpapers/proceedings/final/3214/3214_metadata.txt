Abstract#==#This paper addresses the task of AMR-to-text generation by leveraging
synchronous
node replacement grammar. During training, graph-to-string rules are learned
using a heuristic extraction algorithm. At test time, a graph transducer is
applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences. Evaluated on a
standard benchmark, our method gives the state-of-the-art result.
