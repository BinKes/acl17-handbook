Abstract#==#There is a growing demand for automatic assessment of spoken English
proficiency. These systems need to handle large variations in input
data owing to the wide range of candidate skill levels and L1s, and
errors from ASR. Some candidates will be a poor match
to the training data set, undermining the validity of the predicted grade. For
high stakes tests it is essential for such systems not only to grade well, but
also to provide a measure
of their uncertainty in their predictions, enabling rejection to human
graders. Previous work examined Gaussian Process (GP) graders which, though
successful, do not scale well with large data sets. Deep Neural Network (DNN)
may also be used to provide uncertainty using Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD). This
paper proposes a novel method to yield uncertainty and compares it to GPs and
DNNs with MCD. The proposed approach explicitly teaches a DNN to have low
uncertainty on training data and high uncertainty on generated artificial data.
On experiments conducted on data from the Business Language Testing Service
(BULATS), the proposed approach is found to outperform GPs and DNNs with MCD in
uncertainty-based rejection whilst achieving comparable grading performance.
