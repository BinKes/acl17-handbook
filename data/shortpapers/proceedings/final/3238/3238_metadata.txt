Abstract#==#Discourse segmentation is a crucial step in building end-to-end discourse
parsers. However, discourse segmenters only exist for a few languages and
domains. Typically they only  detect intra-sentential segment boundaries,
assuming gold standard sentence and token segmentation, and relying on
high-quality syntactic parses and rich heuristics that are not generally
available across languages and domains. In this paper, we propose statistical
discourse segmenters for five languages and three domains that do not rely on
gold pre-annotations.  We also consider the problem of learning discourse
segmenters when no labeled data is available for a language. Our fully
supervised system obtains 89.5% F1 for English newswire, with slight drops in
performance on other domains, and we report supervised and unsupervised
(cross-lingual) results for five languages in total.
