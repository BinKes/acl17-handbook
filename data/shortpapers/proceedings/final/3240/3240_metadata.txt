Abstract#==#This study explores the role of speech register and prosody for the task of
word segmentation. Since these two factors are thought to play an important
role in early language acquisition, we aim to quantify their contribution for
this task. We study a Japanese corpus containing both infant- and
adult-directed speech and we apply four different word segmentation models,
with and without knowledge of prosodic boundaries. The results showed that the
difference between registers is smaller than previously reported and that
prosodic boundary information helps more adult- than infant-directed speech.
