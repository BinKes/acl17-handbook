Abstract#==#Recently, the neural machine translation systems showed their promising
performance and surpassed the phrase-based systems for most translation tasks.
Retreating into conventional concepts machine translation while utilizing
effective neural models is vital for comprehending the leap accomplished by
neural machine translation over phrase-based methods. This work proposes a
direct HMM with neural network-based lexicon and alignment models, which are
trained jointly using the Baum-Welch algorithm. The direct HMM is applied to
rerank the n-best list created by a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation
system and it provides improvements by up to 1.0% Bleu scores on two different
translation tasks.
