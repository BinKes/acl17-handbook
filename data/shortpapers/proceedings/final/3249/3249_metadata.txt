Abstract#==#The quality of a Neural Machine Translation system depends substantially on the
availability of sizable parallel corpora.
For low-resource language pairs this is not the case, resulting in poor
translation quality. 
Inspired by work in computer vision, we propose a novel data augmentation
approach that targets low-frequency words by generating new sentence pairs
containing rare words in new, synthetically created contexts.
Experimental results on simulated low-resource settings show that our method
improves translation quality by up to 2.9 BLEU points over the baseline and up
to 3.2 BLEU over back-translation.
