Abstract#==#Previous models for the assessment of commitment towards a predicate in a
sentence (also known as factuality prediction) were trained and tested against
a specific annotated dataset, subsequently limiting the generality of their
results. In this work we propose an intuitive method for mapping three
previously annotated corpora onto a single factuality scale, thereby enabling
models to be tested across these corpora. In addition, we design a novel model
for factuality prediction by first extending a previous rule-based factuality
prediction system and applying it over an abstraction of dependency trees, and
then using the output of this system in a supervised classifier. We show that
this model outperforms previous methods on all three datasets. We make both the
unified factuality corpus and our new model publicly available.
