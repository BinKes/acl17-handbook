Abstract#==#Information extraction (IE) from text has largely focused on relations between
individual entities, such as who has won which award. However, some facts are
never fully mentioned, and no IE method has perfect recall. Thus, it is
beneficial to also tap contents about the cardinalities of these relations, for
example, how many awards someone has won. We introduce this novel problem of
extracting cardinalities and discusses the specific challenges that set it
apart from standard IE. We present a distant supervision method using
conditional random fields. A preliminary evaluation results in precision
between 3% and 55%, depending on the difficulty of relations.
