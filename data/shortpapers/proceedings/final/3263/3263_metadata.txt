Abstract#==#Previous work introduced transition-based algorithms to form a unified
architecture
of parsing rhetorical structures (including span, nuclearity and relation), but
did not achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose that
transition-based model is more appropriate for parsing the naked discourse tree
(i.e., identifying span and nuclearity) due to data sparsity. At the same time,
we argue that relation labeling can benefit from naked tree structure and
should be treated elaborately with consideration of three kinds of relations
including within-sentence, across-sentence and across-paragraph relations.
Thus, we design a pipelined two-stage parsing method for generating an RST tree
from text. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, especially on span and nuclearity identification.
