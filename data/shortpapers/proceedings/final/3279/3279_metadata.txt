Abstract#==#While natural languages are compositional, how state-of-the-art neural models
achieve compositionality is still unclear. We propose a deep network, which 
not only achieves competitive accuracy for text classification, but also 
exhibits compositional behavior. That is, while creating hierarchical 
representations of a piece of text, such as a sentence, the lower layers of the
network distribute their layer-specific attention weights to individual words.
In contrast, the higher layers compose meaningful phrases and clauses, whose
lengths increase as the networks get deeper until fully composing the 
sentence.
