Abstract#==#Rating scales are a widely used method for data annotation; however, they
present several challenges, such as difficulty in maintaining inter- and
intra-annotator consistency. Bestâ€“worst scaling (BWS) is an alternative
method of annotation that is claimed to produce high-quality annotations while
keeping the required number of annotations similar to that of rating scales.
However, the veracity of this claim has never been systematically established.
Here for the first time, we set up an experiment that directly compares the
rating scale method with BWS. We show that with the same total number of
annotations, BWS produces significantly more reliable results than the rating
scale.
