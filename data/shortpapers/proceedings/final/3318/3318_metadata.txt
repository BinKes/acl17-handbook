Abstract#==#In this paper we define a measure of dependency between two random variables,
based on the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between their joint distribution
and the product of their marginal distributions. Then, we show that word2vec's
skip-gram with negative sampling embedding algorithm finds the optimal
low-dimensional approximation of this JS dependency measure between the words
and their contexts. The gap between the optimal score and the low-dimensional
approximation is demonstrated on a standard text corpus.
