Abstract#==#We present a new framework for evaluating extractive summarizers, which is
based on a principled representation as optimization problem. We prove that
every extractive summarizer can be decomposed into an objective function  and
an optimization technique. We perform a comparative analysis and evaluation of
several objective functions embedded in well-known summarizers regarding their
correlation with human judgments. Our comparison of these correlations across
two datasets yields surprising insights into the role and performance of
objective functions in the different  summarizers.
