Abstract#==#We propose a new dependency parsing scheme which jointly parses a sentence and
repairs grammatical errors by extending the non-directional transition-based
formalism of Goldberg and Elhadad (2010) with three additional actions:
SUBSTITUTE, DELETE, INSERT. Because these actions may cause an infinite loop in
derivation, we also introduce simple constraints that ensure the parser
termination. We evaluate our model with respect to dependency accuracy and
grammaticality improvements for ungrammatical sentences, demonstrating the
robustness and applicability of our scheme.
