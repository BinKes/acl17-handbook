Abstract#==#Automatic identification of good arguments on a controversial topic has
applications in civics and education, to name a few. While in the civics
context it might be acceptable to create separate models for  each topic, in
the context of              scoring of students' writing there is a preference for a
single
model that applies to all responses. Given that good arguments for one topic
are likely to be irrelevant for another, is a single model for detecting good
arguments a contradiction in terms? We investigate the extent to which it is
possible to close the performance gap between topic-specific and across-topics
models for identification of good arguments.
