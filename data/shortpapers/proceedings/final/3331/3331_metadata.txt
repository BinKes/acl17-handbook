Abstract#==#Keyphrase boundary classification (KBC) is the task of detecting keyphrases in
scientific articles and labelling them with respect to predefined types.
Although important in practice, this task is so far underexplored, partly due
to the lack of labelled data. 
To overcome this, we explore several auxiliary tasks, including semantic
super-sense tagging and identification of multi-word expressions, and cast the
task as a multi-task learning problem with deep recurrent neural networks. Our
multi-task models perform significantly better than previous state of the art
approaches on two scientific KBC datasets, particularly for long keyphrases.
