Abstract#==#Automatically estimating a user's socio-economic profile from their language
use in social media can significantly help social science research and various
downstream applications ranging from business to politics. The current paper
presents the first study where user cognitive structure is used to build a
predictive model of income. In particular, we first develop a classifier using
a weakly supervised learning framework to automatically time-tag tweets as
past, present, or future. We quantify a user's overall temporal orientation
based on their distribution of tweets, and use it to build a predictive model
of income. Our analysis uncovers a correlation between future temporal
orientation and income. Finally, we measure the predictive power of future
temporal orientation on income by performing regression.
