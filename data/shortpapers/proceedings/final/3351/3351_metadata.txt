Abstract#==#The availability of the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) Discourse Treebank
has spurred substantial research into discourse analysis of written texts;
however, limited research has been conducted to date on RST annotation and
parsing of spoken language, in particular, non-native spontaneous speech.
Considering that the measurement of discourse coherence is typically a key
metric in human scoring rubrics for assessments of spoken language, we
initiated a research effort to obtain RST annotations of a large number of
non-native spoken responses from a standardized assessment of academic English
proficiency. The resulting inter-annotator kappa agreements on the three
different levels of Span, Nuclearity, and Relation are 0.848, 0.766, and 0.653,
respectively. Furthermore, a set of features was explored to evaluate the
discourse structure of non-native spontaneous speech based on these
annotations; the highest performing feature resulted in a correlation of 0.612
with scores of discourse coherence provided by expert human raters.
