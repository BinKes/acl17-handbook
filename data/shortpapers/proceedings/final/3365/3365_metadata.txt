Abstract#==#Counterfactual statements, describing events that did not occur and their
consequents, have been studied in areas including problem-solving, affect
management, and behavior regulation. People with more counterfactual thinking
tend to perceive life events as more personally meaningful. Nevertheless,
counterfactuals have not been studied in computational linguistics. We create a
counterfactual tweet dataset and explore approaches for detecting
counterfactuals using rule-based and supervised statistical approaches. A
combined rule-based and statistical approach yielded the best results (F1 =
0.77) outperforming either approach used alone.
