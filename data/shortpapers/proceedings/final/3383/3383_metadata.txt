Abstract#==#Pew research polls report 62 percent of U.S. adults get news on social media
(Gottfried and Shearer, 2016). In a December poll, 64 percent of U.S. adults
said that “made-up news” has caused a “great deal of confusion” about
the facts of current events (Barthel et al., 2016). Fabricated stories in
social media, ranging from deliberate propaganda to hoaxes and satire,
contributes to this confusion in addition to having serious effects on global
stability.
In this work we build predictive models to classify 130 thousand news posts as
suspicious or verified, and predict four sub-types of suspicious news –
satire, hoaxes, clickbait and propaganda. We show that neural network models
trained on tweet content and social network interactions outperform lexical
models. Unlike previous work on deception detection, we find that adding syntax
and grammar features to our models does not improve performance. Incorporating
linguistic features improves classification results, however, social
interaction features are most in- formative for finer-grained separation be-
tween four types of suspicious news posts.
