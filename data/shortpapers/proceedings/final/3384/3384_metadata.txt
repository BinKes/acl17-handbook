Abstract#==#In this paper, we explore spelling errors as a source of information for
detecting the native language of a writer, a previously under-explored area.
 We note that character n-grams from misspelled words are very indicative of
the native language of the author. In combination with other lexical features,
spelling error features lead to 1.2\% improvement in accuracy on classifying
texts in the TOEFL11 corpus by the author's native language, compared to
systems participating in the NLI shared task.
