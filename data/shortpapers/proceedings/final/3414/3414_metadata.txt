Abstract#==#Existing Knowledge Base Population methods extract relations from a closed
relational schema with limited coverage leading to sparse KBs. We propose
Pocket Knowledge Base Population (PKBP), the task of dynamically constructing a
KB of entities related to a query and finding the best characterization of
relationships between entities. We describe novel Open Information Extraction
methods which leverage the PKB to find informative trigger words. We evaluate
using existing KBP shared-task data as well anew annotations collected for this
work. Our methods produce high quality KB from just text with many more
entities and relationships than existing KBP systems.
