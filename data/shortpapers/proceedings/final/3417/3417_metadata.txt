Abstract#==#We propose a simple yet effective text-based user geolocation model based on a
neural network with one hidden layer, which achieves state of the art
performance over three Twitter benchmark geolocation datasets, in addition to
producing word                                and phrase embeddings in the hidden
layer
that we
show to
be
useful for detecting dialectal terms. As part of our analysis of dialectal
terms, we release DAREDS, a dataset for evaluating dialect term detection
methods.
