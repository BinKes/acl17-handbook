Abstract#==#Selecting appropriate words to compose a sentence is one common problem faced
by non-native Chinese learners. In this paper, we propose (bidirectional) LSTM
sequence labeling models and explore various features to detect word usage
errors in Chinese sentences. By combining CWINDOW word embedding features and
POS information, the best bidirectional LSTM model achieves accuracy 0.5138 and
MRR 0.6789 on the HSK dataset. For 80.79% of the test data, the model ranks the
ground-truth within the top two at position level.
