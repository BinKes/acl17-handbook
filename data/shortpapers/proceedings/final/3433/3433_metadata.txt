Abstract#==#While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA),
answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a
large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction
(Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to
date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with
retrieval-based methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for
reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be
handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA,
we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work
effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of
tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured
solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the
reliance on manually curated knowledge.
