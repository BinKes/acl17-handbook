Abstract#==#We show the equivalence of two state-of-the-art models for 
link prediction/knowledge graph completion:
Nickel et al's holographic embeddings and Trouillon et al.'s complex
embeddings.
We first consider a spectral version of the holographic embeddings,
exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform for efficient
computation.
The analysis of the resulting model reveals that it can be viewed as
an instance of the complex embeddings
with a certain constraint imposed on the initial vectors upon training.
Conversely, any set of complex embeddings can be converted to a set of
equivalent holographic embeddings.
