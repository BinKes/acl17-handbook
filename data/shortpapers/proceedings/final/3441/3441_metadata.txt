Abstract#==#People around the globe respond to major real world events through social
media.              To study targeted public sentiments across many languages and
geographic locations, we introduce multilingual connotation frames: an
extension from English connotation frames of Rashkin et al. (2016) with 10
additional European languages, focusing on the implied sentiments among event
participants engaged in a frame. As a case study, we present large scale
analysis on targeted public sentiments toward salient events and entities using
1.2 million multilingual connotation frames extracted from Twitter.
