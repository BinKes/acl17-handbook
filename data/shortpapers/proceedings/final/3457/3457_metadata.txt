Abstract#==#We develop a language-independent, deep learning-based approach to the task of
morphological disambiguation.
Guided by the intuition that the correct analysis should be ``most similar'' to
the context, we propose dense representations for morphological analyses and
surface context and a simple yet effective way of combining the two to perform
disambiguation.
Our approach improves on the language-dependent state of the art for two
agglutinative languages (Turkish and Kazakh) and can be potentially applied to
other morphologically complex languages.
