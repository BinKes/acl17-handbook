Abstract#==#A common test administered during neurological examination is the semantic
fluency test, in which the patient must list as many examples of a given
semantic category as possible under timed conditions. Poor performance 
is associated with neurological conditions characterized
by impairments in executive function, such as dementia, schizophrenia, and
autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods for analyzing semantic fluency responses at 
the level of detail necessary to uncover these differences have typically
relied on subjective manual annotation.
In this paper, we explore automated approaches for scoring semantic fluency 
responses that leverage ontological resources and distributional semantic
models to characterize the semantic fluency responses 
produced by young children with and without ASD. Using these methods, we find
significant differences
in the semantic fluency responses of children with ASD, demonstrating
the utility of using objective methods for clinical language analysis.
