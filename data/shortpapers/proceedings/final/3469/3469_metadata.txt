Abstract#==#Temporal relation classification is becoming an active research field. Lots of
methods have been proposed, while most of them focus on extracting features
from external resources. Less attention has been paid to a significant advance
in a closely related task: relation extraction. In this work, we borrow a
state-of-the-art method in relation extraction by adopting bidirectional long
short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) along dependency paths (DP). We make a “common
root” assumption to extend DP representations of cross-sentence links. In the
final comparison to two state-of-the-art systems on TimeBank-Dense, our model
achieves comparable performance, without using external knowledge, as well as
manually annotated attributes of entities (class, tense, polarity, etc.).
