Abstract#==#Existing question answering methods infer answers either from a knowledge base
or from raw text. 
While knowledge base (KB) methods are good at answering compositional
questions, their performance is often affected by the incompleteness of the KB.
Au contraire, 
web text contains millions of facts that are absent in the KB, however in an
unstructured form. Universal schema can support reasoning on the union of
both structured KBs and unstructured text by aligning them in a common embedded
space. In this paper we extend universal schema to natural language question
answering, employing Memory networks to attend to the large body of
facts in the combination of text and KB.
Our models can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on question-answer pairs.
Evaluation results on Spades fill-in-the-blank question answering dataset show
that exploiting universal schema for question answering is better than using
either a KB or text alone. 
This model also outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 8.5 F1 points.
