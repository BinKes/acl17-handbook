Abstract#==#This paper derives an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation to obtain an
oracle summary of the compressive summarization paradigm in terms of ROUGE. The
oracle summary is essential to reveal the upper bound performance of the
paradigm. Experimental results on the DUC dataset showed that ROUGE scores of
compressive oracles are significantly higher than those of extractive oracles
and state-of-the-art summarization systems. These results reveal that
compressive summarization is a promising  paradigm and encourage us to continue
with the research to produce informative summaries.
