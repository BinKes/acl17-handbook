Abstract#==#Compositor attribution, the clustering of pages in a historical printed
document by the individual who set the type, is a bibliographic task that
relies on analysis of orthographic variation and inspection of visual details
of the printed page. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised model
that jointly describes the textual and visual features needed to distinguish
compositors. Applied to images of Shakespeare's First Folio, our model predicts
attributions that agree with the manual judgements of bibliographers with an
accuracy of 87%, even on text that is the output of OCR.
