Abstract#==#This paper describes an approach to determine whether people participate in the
events they tweet about. Specifically, we determine whether people are
participants in events with respect to the tweet timestamp. We target all
events expressed by verbs in tweets, including past, present and events that
may occur in the future. We present new annotations using 1,096 event mentions,
and experimental results showing that the task is challenging.
