Abstract#==#Question classification is an important task with wide applications.
However, traditional techniques treat questions as general sentences, ignoring
the corresponding answer data.
In order to consider answer information into question modeling, 
we first introduce novel group sparse autoencoders 
which refine question representation by utilizing group information in the
answer set.
We then propose novel group sparse CNNs 
which naturally learn question representation with respect
to their answers by implanting group sparse autoencoders into traditional CNNs.
The proposed model significantly outperform strong baselines on four datasets.
