Abstract#==#Twitter should be an ideal place to get a fresh read on how different issues
are playing with the public, one that's potentially more reflective of
democracy in this new media age than traditional polls. Pollsters typically ask
people a fixed set of questions, while in social media people use their own
voices to speak about whatever is on their minds. However, the demographic
distribution of users on Twitter is not representative of the general
population. In this paper, we present a demographic classifier for gender, age,
political orientation and location on Twitter. We collected and curated a
robust Twitter demographic dataset for this task. Our classifier uses a deep
multi-modal multi-task learning architecture to reach a state-of-the-art
performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.89, 0.82, 0.86, and 0.68 for gender,
age, political orientation, and location respectively.
