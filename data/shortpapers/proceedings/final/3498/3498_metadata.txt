Abstract#==#We consider the ROC story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) and present
several findings. We develop a model that uses hierarchical recurrent networks
with attention to encode the sentences in the story and score candidate
endings. By discarding the large training set and only training on the
validation set, we achieve an accuracy of 74.7%. Even when we discard the story
plots (sentences before the ending) and only train to choose the better of two
endings, we can still reach 72.5%. We then analyze this “ending-only” task
setting. We estimate human accuracy to be 78% and find several types of clues
that lead to this high accuracy, including those related to sentiment,
negation, and general ending likelihood regardless of the story context.
