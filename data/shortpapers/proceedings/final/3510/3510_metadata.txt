Abstract#==#We present the first attempt at using sequence to sequence neural networks to
model text simplification (TS). Unlike the previously proposed automated TS
systems, our neural text simplification (NTS) systems are able to
simultaneously perform lexical simplification and content reduction. An
extensive human evaluation of the output has shown that NTS systems achieve
almost perfect                          grammaticality and meaning preservation of
output
sentences and
higher level of simplification than the state-of-the-art automated TS systems
