Abstract#==#A critical task for question answering is the final answer selection stage,
which has to combine multiple signals available about each answer candidate.
This paper proposes EviNets: a novel neural network architecture for factoid
question answering. EviNets scores candidate answer entities by combining the
available supporting evidence, e.g., structured knowledge bases and
unstructured text documents. EviNets represents each piece of evidence with a
dense embeddings vector, scores their relevance to the question, and aggregates
the support for each candidate to predict their final scores. Each of the
components is generic and allows plugging in a variety of models for semantic
similarity scoring and information aggregation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of EviNets in experiments on the existing TREC QA and WikiMovies
benchmarks, and on the new Yahoo! Answers dataset introduced in this paper.
EviNets can be extended to other information types and could facilitate future
work on combining evidence signals for joint reasoning in question answering.
