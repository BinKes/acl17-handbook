Abstract#==#This paper highlights challenges in industrial research related to translating
research in natural language processing into commercial products.
While the interest in natural language processing from industry is
significant, the transfer of research to commercial products is
non-trivial and its challenges are often unknown to or underestimated
by many researchers. I discuss current obstacles and provide
suggestions for increasing the chances for translating research to commercial
success based on my experience in industrial research.
