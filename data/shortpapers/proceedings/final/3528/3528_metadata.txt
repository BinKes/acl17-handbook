Abstract#==#We propose a model to automatically describe changes introduced in the source
code of a program using natural language. Our method receives as input a set of
code commits, which contains both the modifications and  message introduced by
an user. These two modalities are used to train  an encoder-decoder
architecture. We evaluated our approach on twelve real world open source
projects from four different programming languages. Quantitative and
qualitative results showed that the proposed approach can generate feasible and
semantically sound descriptions not only in standard in-project settings, but
also in a cross-project setting.
