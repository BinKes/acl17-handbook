Abstract#==#Language identification (LID) is a critical first step for processing
multilingual text.  Yet most LID systems are not designed to handle the
linguistic diversity of global platforms like Twitter, where local dialects and
rampant code-switching lead language classifiers to systematically miss
minority dialect speakers and multilingual speakers.  We propose a new dataset
and a character-based sequence-to-sequence model for LID designed to support
dialectal and multilingual language varieties. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple LID benchmarks.  Furthermore, in a
case study using Twitter for health tracking,  our method substantially
increases the availability of texts written by underrepresented populations, 
enabling the development of "socially inclusive" NLP tools.
