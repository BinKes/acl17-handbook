Abstract#==#This work explores different approaches of using normalization for parser
adaptation.  Traditionally, normalization is used as separate pre-processing
step. We show that integrating the normalization model into the
parsing algorithm is more beneficial. This way, multiple normalization
candidates can be leveraged, which improves parsing performance on social
media.
We test this hypothesis by modifying the Berkeley parser; out-of-the-box it
achieves an F1 score of 66.52.                          Our integrated approach
reaches a
significant
improvement with an F1 score of 67.36, while using the best normalization
sequence results in an F1 score of only 66.94.
