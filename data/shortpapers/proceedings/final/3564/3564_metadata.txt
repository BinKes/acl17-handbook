Abstract#==#We present a simple method to incorporate syntactic information about the
target language in a neural machine translation system by translating into
linearized, lexicalized constituency trees. An experiment on the WMT16
German-English news translation task resulted in an improved BLEU score when
compared to a syntax-agnostic NMT baseline trained on the same dataset. An
analysis of the translations from the syntax-aware system shows that it
performs more reordering during translation in comparison to the baseline. A
small-scale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware
system.
