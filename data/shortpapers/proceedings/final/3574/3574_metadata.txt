Abstract#==#In social media, demographic inference is a critical task in order to gain a
better understanding of a cohort and to facilitate interacting with one's
audience. Most previous work has made independence assumptions over
topological, textual and label information on social networks. In this work, we
employ recursive neural networks to break down these independence assumptions
to obtain inference about demographic characteristics on Twitter. We show that
our model performs better than existing models including the state-of-the-art.
