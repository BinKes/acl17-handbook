Abstract#==#We propose jointly modelling Knowledge Bases and aligned text with Feature-Rich
Networks. Our models perform Knowledge Base Completion by learning to represent
and compose diverse feature types from partially aligned and noisy resources.
We perform experiments on Freebase utilizing additional entity type information
and syntactic textual relations. Our evaluation suggests that the proposed
models can better incorporate side information than previously proposed
combinations of bilinear models with convolutional neural networks, showing
large improvements when scoring the plausibility of unobserved facts with
associated textual mentions.
