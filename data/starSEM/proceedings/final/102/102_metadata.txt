Abstract#==#With the explosive growth of Internet, more and more domain-specific
environments appear, such as forums, blogs, MOOCs and etc. Domain-specific
words appear in these areas and always play a critical role in the
domain-specific NLP tasks. This paper aims at extracting Chinese
domain-specific new words automatically. The extraction of domain-specific new
words has two parts including both new words in this domain and the especially
important words. In this work, we propose a joint statistical model to perform
these two works simultaneously. Compared to traditional new words detection
models, our model doesn't need handcraft features which are labor intensive.
Experimental results demonstrate that our joint model achieves a better
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
