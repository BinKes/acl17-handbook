Abstract#==#Recently, several datasets have become available which represent natural
language phenomena as graphs. Hyperedge Replacement Languages (HRL) have been
the focus of much attention as a formalism to represent the graphs in these
datasets. Chiang et al. (2013) prove that HRL graphs can be parsed in
polynomial time with respect to the size of the input graph. We believe that
HRL are more expressive than is necessary to represent semantic graphs and we
propose the use of Regular Graph Languages (RGL; Courcelle 1991), which is a
subfamily of HRL, as a possible alternative. We provide a top-down parsing
algorithm for RGL that runs in time linear in the size of the input graph.
