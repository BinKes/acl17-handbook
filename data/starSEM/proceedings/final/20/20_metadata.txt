Abstract#==#Schizophrenia is one of the most disabling and difficult to treat of all human
medical/health conditions, ranking in the top ten causes of disability
worldwide. It has been a puzzle in part due to difficulty in identifying its
basic, fundamental components. Several studies have shown that some
manifestations of schizophrenia (e.g., the negative symptoms that include
blunting of speech prosody, as well as the disorganization symptoms that lead
to disordered language) can be understood from the perspective of linguistics.
However, schizophrenia research has not kept pace with technologies in
computational linguistics, especially in semantics and pragmatics. As such, we
examine the writings of schizophrenia patients analyzing their syntax,
semantics and pragmatics. In addition, we analyze tweets of (self proclaimed)
schizophrenia patients who publicly discuss their diagnoses. For writing
samples dataset, syntactic features are found to be the most successful in
classification whereas for the less structured Twitter dataset, a combination
of  features performed the best.
