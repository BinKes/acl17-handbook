Abstract#==#Word embeddings are supposed to provide easy access to semantic relations such
as "male of" (man–woman). While this claim has been investigated for
concepts, little is known about the distributional behavior of relations of
(Named) Entities. We describe two word embedding-based models that predict
values for relational attributes of entities, and analyse them. The task is
challenging, with major performance differences between relations. Contrary to
many NLP tasks, high difficulty for a relation does not result from low
frequency, but from (a) one-to-many mappings; and (b) lack of context patterns
expressing the relation that are easy to pick up by word
embeddings.
