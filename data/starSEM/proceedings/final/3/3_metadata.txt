Abstract#==#We present a simple method for ever-growing extraction of predicate paraphrases
from news headlines in Twitter. Analysis of the output of ten weeks of
collection shows that the accuracy of paraphrases with different support levels
is estimated between 60-86\%. We also demonstrate that our resource is to a
large extent complementary to existing resources, providing many novel
paraphrases. Our resource is publicly available, continuously expanding based
on daily news.
