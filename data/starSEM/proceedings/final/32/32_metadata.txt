Abstract#==#Humans as well as animals are good at imitation. Inspired by this, the learning
by demonstration view of machine learning learns to perform a task from
detailed example demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce the task of
question answering using natural language demonstrations where the question
answering system is provided with detailed demonstrative solutions to questions
in natural language. As a case study, we explore the task of learning to solve
geometry problems using demonstrative solutions available in textbooks. We
collect a new dataset of demonstrative geometry solutions from textbooks and
explore approaches that learn to interpret these demonstrations as well as to
use these interpretations to solve geometry problems. Our approaches show
improvements over the best previously published system for solving geometry
problems.
