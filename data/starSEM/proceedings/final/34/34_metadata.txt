Abstract#==#Script knowledge plays a central role in text understanding and is relevant for
a variety of downstream tasks. In this paper, we consider two recent datasets
which provide a rich and general representation of script events in terms of
paraphrase sets. We introduce the task of mapping event mentions in narrative
texts to such script event types, and present a model for this task that
exploits rich linguistic representations as well as information on temporal
ordering. The results of our experiments demonstrate that this complex task is
indeed feasible.
