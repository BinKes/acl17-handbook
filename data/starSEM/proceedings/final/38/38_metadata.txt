Abstract#==#This paper presents the results of systematic experimentation on the impact in
duplicate question detection of different types of questions across both a
number of established approaches and a novel, superior one used to address this
language
processing task. This study permits to gain a novel insight on the different
levels of robustness of the diverse detection methods with respect to different
conditions of their application, including the ones that approximate real usage
scenarios.
