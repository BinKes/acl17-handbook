Abstract#==#Detecting aspectual properties of clauses in the form of situation entity types
has been shown to depend on a combination of syntactic-semantic and contextual
features. We explore this task in a deep-learning framework, where tuned word
representations capture lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We introduce
an attention mechanism that pinpoints relevant context not only for the current
instance, but also for the larger context. Apart from implicitly capturing task
relevant features, the advantage of our neural model is that it avoids the need
to reproduce linguistic features for other languages and is thus more easily
transferable. We present experiments for English and German that achieve
competitive performance. We present a novel take on modeling and exploiting
genre information and showcase the adaptation of our system from one language
to another.
