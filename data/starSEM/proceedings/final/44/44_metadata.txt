Abstract#==#Creating annotated frame lexicons such as PropBank and FrameNet is expensive
and labor intensive. We present a method to induce an embedded frame lexicon in
an minimally supervised fashion using nothing more than unlabeled
predicate-argument word pairs. We hypothesize that aggregating such pair
selectional preferences across training leads us to a global understanding that
captures predicate-argument frame structure. Our approach revolves around a
novel integration between a predictive embedding model and an Indian Buffet
Process posterior regularizer. We show, through our experimental evaluation,
that we outperform baselines on two tasks and can learn an embedded frame
lexicon that is able to capture some interesting generalities in relation to
hand-crafted semantic frames.
