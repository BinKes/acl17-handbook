Abstract#==#The Practical Lexical Function (PLF) model is a model of computational
distributional semantics that attempts to strike a balance between expressivity
and learnability in predicting phrase meaning and shows competitive results. We
investigate how well the PLF carries over to free word order languages, given
that it builds on observations of predicate-argument combinations that are
harder to recover in free word order languages. We evaluate variants of the PLF
for Croatian, using a new lexical substitution dataset. We find that the PLF
works about as well for Croatian as for English, but demonstrate that its
strength lies in modeling verbs, and that the free word order affects the less
robust PLF variant.
