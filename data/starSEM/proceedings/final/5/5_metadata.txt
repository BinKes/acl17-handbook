Abstract#==#This paper explores the automatic learning of distributed representations of
the target's context for semantic frame labeling with target-based neural
model. We constrain the whole sentence as the model's input without feature
extraction from the sentence. This is different from many previous works in
which local feature extraction of the targets is widely used. This constraint
makes the task harder, especially with long sentences, but also makes our model
easily applicable to a range of resources and other similar tasks. We evaluate
our model on several resources and get the state-of-the-art result on subtask 2
of SemEval 2015 task 15. Finally, we extend the task to word-sense
disambiguation task and we also achieve a strong result in comparison to
state-of-the-art work.
