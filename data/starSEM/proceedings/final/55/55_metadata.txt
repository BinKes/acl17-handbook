Abstract#==#In theoretical linguistics, logical metonymy is defined as the combination of
an event-subcategorizing verb with an entity-denoting direct object (e.g., The
author began the book), so that the interpretation of the VP requires the
retrieval of a covert event (e.g., writing). Psycholinguistic studies have
revealed extra processing costs for logical metonymy, a phenomenon generally
explained with the introduction of new semantic structure.
In this paper, we present a general distributional model for sentence
comprehension inspired by the Memory, Unification and Control model by Hagoort
(2013,2016). We show that our distributional framework can account for the
extra processing costs of logical metonymy and can identify the covert event in
a classification task.
