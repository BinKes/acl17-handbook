Abstract#==#Word embeddings are now a standard technique for inducing meaning
representations for words. For getting good representations, it is important to
take into account different senses of a word. In this paper, we propose a
mixture model for learning multi-sense word embeddings. Our model generalizes
the previous works in that it allows to induce different weights of different
senses of a word. The experimental results show that our model outperforms
previous models on standard evaluation tasks.
