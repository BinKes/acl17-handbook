Abstract#==#Multiword expressions (MWEs) are lexical items that can be decomposed
into multiple component words, but have properties that are
unpredictable with respect to their component words. In this paper we
propose the first deep learning models for token-level identification
of MWEs. Specifically, we consider a layered feedforward network, a
recurrent neural network, and convolutional neural networks. In
experimental results we show that convolutional neural networks are
able to outperform the previous state-of-the-art for MWE
identification, with a convolutional neural network with three hidden
layers giving the best performance.
