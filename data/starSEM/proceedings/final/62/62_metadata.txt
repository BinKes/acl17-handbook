Abstract#==#This paper explores the possibilities of analogical reasoning with vector space
models. Given two pairs of words with the same relation (e.g. man:woman ::
king:queen), it was proposed that the offset between one pair of the
corresponding word vectors can be used to identify the unknown member of the
other pair (king - man + woman = queen). We argue against such "linguistic
regularities" as a model for linguistic relations in vector space models and as
a benchmark, and we show that the vector offset (as well as two other,
better-performing methods) suffers from dependence on vector similarity.
