Abstract#==#WordNet has facilitated important research in natural language processing but
its usefulness is somewhat limited by its relatively small lexical coverage.
The Paraphrase Database (PPDB) covers 650 times more words, but lacks the
semantic structure of WordNet that would make it more directly useful for
downstream tasks. We present a method for mapping words from PPDB to WordNet
synsets with 89\% accuracy. The mapping also lays important groundwork for
incorporating WordNet's relations into PPDB so as to increase its utility for
semantic reasoning in applications.
