Abstract#==#Relation extraction is the task of recognizing and extracting relations between
entities or concepts in texts. A common approach is to exploit existing
knowledge to learn linguistic patterns expressing the target relation and use
these patterns for extracting new relation mentions. Deriving relation patterns
automatically usually results in large numbers of candidates, which need to be
ﬁltered to derive a subset of patterns that reliably extract correct relation
mentions. We address the pattern selection task by exploiting the knowledge
represented by entailment graphs, which capture semantic relationships holding
among the learned pattern candidates. This is motivated by the fact that a
pattern may not express the target relation explicitly, but still be useful for
extracting instances for which the relation holds, because its meaning entails
the meaning of the target relation. We evaluate the usage of both automatically
generated and gold-standard entailment graphs in a relation extraction scenario
and present favorable experimental results, exhibiting the beneﬁts of
structuring and selecting patterns based on entailment graphs.
