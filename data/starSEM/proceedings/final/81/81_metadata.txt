Abstract#==#Collecting spontaneous speech corpora that are open-ended, yet topically
constrained, is increasingly popular for research in spoken dialogue systems
and speaker state, inter alia. Typically, these corpora are labeled by human
annotators, either in the lab or through crowd-sourcing; however, this is
cumbersome and time-consuming for large corpora. We present four different
approaches to automatically tagging a corpus when general topics of the
conversations are known. We develop these approaches on the Columbia X-Cultural
Deception corpus and find accuracy that significantly exceeds the baseline.
Finally, we conduct a cross-corpus evaluation by testing the best performing
approach on the Columbia/SRI/Colorado corpus.
