Abstract#==#We propose an online, end-to-end, neural generative conversational model for
open-domain dialogue. It is trained using a unique combination of offline
two-phase supervised learning and online human-in-the-loop active learning.
While most existing research proposes offline supervision or hand-crafted
reward functions for online reinforcement, we devise a novel interactive
learning mechanism based on hamming-diverse beam search for response generation
and one-character user-feedback at each step. Experiments show that our model
inherently promotes the generation of semantically relevant and interesting
responses, and can be used to train agents with customized personas, moods and
conversational styles.
