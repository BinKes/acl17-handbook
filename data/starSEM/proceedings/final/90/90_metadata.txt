Abstract#==#We introduce WHiC, a challenging testbed for detecting hypernymy, an asymmetric
relation between words. While previous work has focused on detecting hypernymy
between word types, we ground the meaning of words in specific contexts drawn
from WordNet examples, and require predictions to be sensitive to changes in
contexts. WHiC lets us analyze complementary properties of two approaches of
inducing vector representations of word meaning in context. We show that such
contextualized word representations also improve detection of a wider range of
semantic relations in context.
