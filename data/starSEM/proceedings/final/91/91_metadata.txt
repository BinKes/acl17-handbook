Abstract#==#Recognizing and distinguishing antonyms from other types of semantic relations
is an essential part of language understanding systems. In this paper, we
present a novel method for deriving antonym pairs using paraphrase pairs
containing negation markers. We further propose a neural network model, AntNET,
that integrates morphological features indicative of antonymy into a path-based
relation detection algorithm. We demonstrate that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art models in distinguishing antonyms from other semantic
relations and is capable of efficiently handling multi-word expressions.
