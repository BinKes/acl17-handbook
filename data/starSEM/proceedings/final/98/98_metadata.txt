Abstract#==#Analogy completion via vector arithmetic has become a common means of
demonstrating the compositionality of word embeddings. Previous work have shown
that this strategy works more reliably for certain types of analogical word
relationships than for others, but these studies have not offered a convincing
account for why this is the case. We arrive at such an account through an
experiment that targets a wide variety of analogy questions and defines a
baseline condition to more accurately measure the efficacy of our system. We
find that the most reliably solvable analogy categories involve either 1) the
application of a morpheme with clear syntactic effects, 2) male--female
alternations, or 3) named entities. These broader types do not pattern cleanly
along a syntactic--semantic divide. We suggest instead that their commonality
is distributional, in that the difference between the distributions of two
words in any given pair encompasses a relatively small number of word types.
Our study offers a needed explanation for why analogy tests succeed and fail
where they do and provides nuanced insight into the relationship between word
distributions and the theoretical linguistic domains of syntax and semantics.
