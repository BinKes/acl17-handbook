	male-female:career-family association), the “sheer weight of repetition”
	(Phillips and Boroditsky, 2003) of grammatical gender marking could have
	profound effects on the resulting learned vector representations. The research
	presented here explores the interaction between grammatical gender and topical

  abstract  = {Natural language understanding (NLU) is a core component of a dialogue system.
	Recently recurrent neural networks (RNN) obtained strong results on NLU due to
	their superior ability of preserving sequential information over time. 
	Traditionally, the NLU module ignores the contexts of utterances and tags
	semantic slots for utterances considering their flat structures, as the
	underlying RNN structure is a linear chain.
	However, contexts and linguistic properties provide informative cues for better
	understanding.
	This paper introduces a novel model, a generalization of RNN to additionally
	incorporate 1) contextual utterances and 2) non-flat network topologies guided
	by prior knowledge. 
	The model automatically figures out the salient and accurate contexts and
	substructures that are essential to predict the semantic tags of the given
	sentences, resulting in better understanding.
	The experiments showed the significant improvement on contextual and structural
	language understanding scenarios.},

	relied predominantly on lexical features and information users' social

	has found that sub-lexical features are also important reflexes of political

	classification of Twitter users based on only three features: how much
	punctuation and capitalization an account uses and what proportion of their
	tweets are replies.},

	displays a distinct trend compared to all LIWC features, and (2) differs

	four categories: basic analysis, resource construc-tion, identification of
	Arabic dialects and semantic analysis on Arabic dialects. In this paper, we
	address the problem of Arabic lexicon construction. More specifically, we focus
	on Algerian dialect which is spoken by more than 40 million people. Our
	approach consists of three distinct steps: 1) Constructing a dialect lexicon
	and extracting the most intense words from a sentiment lexicon; 2) Merging two
	lexicons (a dialect and a sentiment lexicon) and replacing some letters with
	the most used letters in social media; 3) Enriching a lexicon that takes into
	account spelling variations of words specific to a social media domain. As a
	result, we ended up expanding the original lexicon of 1144 words to a new
	lexicon 25086 words.},
